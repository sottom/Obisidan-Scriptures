We note with regret the passing of President N. Eldon Tanner, who at the time of his death was serving as First Counselor in the First Presidency. Following President Tanner’s death, President Spencer W. Kimball designated President Marion G. Romney as his First Counselor and President Gordon B. Hinckley as his Second Counselor. And this action was later approved by the Council of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve. In view of this, it is proposed that we sustain President Marion G. Romney as First Counselor in the First Presidency, and President Gordon B. Hinckley as Second Counselor in the First Presidency.

All in favor, please manifest it.

Any opposed may so manifest it.

With the exception of these brethren we have just sustained, and noting the passing of our dear friend and brother, Elder LeGrand Richards of the Quorum of the Twelve, there have been no changes in the General Authorities since the last conference. It is proposed, therefore, that we sustain all of the General Authorities and general officers of the Church as at present constituted.

Those in favor, please manifest it.

Those opposed, by the same sign.
