The Vision Which Isaiah the Son of Amoz Saw:

###### 1
In the twentieth year of the reign of Hezekiah, king of Judah, came Isaiah the son of Amoz, and Josab the son of Isaiah to Hezekiah to Jerusalem from Galgala.

###### 2
And (having entered) he sat down on the couch of the king, and they brought him a seat, but he would not sit (thereon).

###### 3
And when Isaiah began to speak the words of faith and truth with King Hezekiah, all the princes of Israel were seated and the eunuchs and the councillors of the king. And there were there forty prophets and sons of the prophets: they had come from the villages and from the mountains and the plains when they had heard that Isaiah was coming from Galgala to Hezekiah.

###### 4
And they had come to salute him and to hear his words.

###### 5
And that he might place his hands upon them, and that they might prophesy and that he might hear their prophecy: and they were all before Isaiah.

###### 6
And when Isaiah was speaking to Hezekiah the words of truth and faith, they all heard a door which one had opened and the voice of the Holy Spirit.

###### 7
And the king summoned all the prophets and all the people who were found there, and they came. and Macaiah and the aged Ananias and Joel and Josab sat on his right hand (and on the left).

###### 8
And it came to pass when they had all heard the voice of the Holy Spirit, they all worshipped on their knees, and glorified the God of truth, the Most High who is in the upper world and who sits on High the Holy One and who rest among His holy ones.

###### 9
And they gave glory to Him who had thus bestowed a door in an alien world had bestowed (it) on a man.

###### 10
And as he was speaking in the Holy Spirit in the hearing of all, he became silent and his mind was taken up from him and he saw not the men that stood before him.

###### 11
Though his eyes indeed were open. Moreover his lips were silent and the mind in his body was taken up from him.

###### 12
But his breath was in him; for he was seeing a vision.

###### 13
And the angel who was sent to make him see was not of this firmament, nor was he of the angels of glory of this world, but he had come from the seventh heaven.

###### 14
And the people who stood near did (not) think, but the circle of the prophets (did), that the holy Isaiah had been taken up.

###### 15
And the vision which the holy Isaiah saw was not from this world but from the world which is hidden from the flesh.

###### 16
And after Isaiah had seen this vision, he narrated it to Hezekiah, and to Josab his son and to the other prophets who had come.

###### 17
But the leaders and the eunuchs and the people did not hear, but only Samna the scribe, and Ijoaqem, and Asaph the recorder; for these also were doers of righteousness, and the sweet smell of the Spirit was upon them. But the people had not heard; for Micaiah and Josab his son had caused them to go forth, when the wisdom of this world had been taken form him and he became as one dead.
