###### 1
And the vision which Isaiah saw, he told to Hezekiah and Josab his son and Micaiah and the rest of the prophets, (and) said:

###### 2
At this moment, when I prophesied according to the (words) heard which ye heard, I saw a glorious angel not like unto the glory of the angels which I used always to see, but possessing such glory ad position that I cannot describe the glory of that angel.

###### 3
And having seized me by my hand he raised me on high, and I said unto him: "Who art thou, and what is thy name, and whither art thou raising me on high? for strength was given me to speak with him."

###### 4
And he said unto me: "When I have raised thee on high [though the (various) degrees] and made thee see the vision, on account of which I have been sent, then thou wilt understand who I am: but my name thou dost not know.

###### 5
Because thou wilt return into this thy body, but whither I am raising thee on high, thou wilt see; for for this purpose have I been sent."

###### 6
And I rejoiced because he spake courteously to me.

###### 7
And he said unto me: "Hast thou rejoiced because I have spoken courteously to thee?" And he said: "And thou wilt see how a grater also that I am will speak courteously and peaceably with thee."

###### 8
And His Father also who is greater thou wilt see; for for this purpose have I been sent from the seventh heaven in order to explain all these things unto thee."

###### 9
And we ascended to the firmament, I and he, and there I saw Sammael and his hosts, and there was great fighting therein and the angels of Satan were envying one another.

###### 10
And as above so on the earth also; for the likeness of that which is in the firmament is here ont he earth.

###### 11
And I said unto the angel (who was with me): "(What is this war and) what is this envying?"

###### 12
And he said unto me: "So has it been since this world was made until now, and this war (will continue) till He, whom thou shalt see will come and destroy him."

###### 13
And afterwards he caused me to ascend (to that which is) above the firmament: which is the (first) heaven.

###### 14
And there I saw a throne in the midst, and on his right and on his left were angels.

###### 15
And (the angels on the left were) not like unto the angels who stood on the right, but those who stood on the right had the greater glory, and they all praised with one voice, and there was a throne in the midst, and those who were out he left gave praise after them; but their voice was not such as the voice of those on the right, nor their praise like the praise of those.

###### 16
And I asked the angel who conducted me, and I said unto him: "To whom is this praise sent?"

###### 17
And he said unto me: "(it is sent) to the praise of (Him who sitteth in) the seventh heaven: to Him who rests in the holy world, and to His Beloved, whence I have been sent to thee. [Thither is it sent.]"

###### 18
And again, he made me to ascend to the second heaven. now the height of that heaven is the same as from the haven to the earth [and to the firmament].

###### 19
And (I saw there, as) in the first heaven, angels on the right and on the left, and a throne in the midst, and the praise of the angels in the second heaven; and he who sat on the throne in the second heaven was more glorious than all (the rest).

###### 20
And there was great glory in the second heaven, and the praise also was not like the praise of those who were in the first heaven.

###### 21
And I fell on my face to worship him, but he angel who conducted me did not permit me, but said unto me: "Worship neither throne nor angel which belongs to the six heavens - for for this cause I was sent to conduct thee j- until I tell thee in the seventh heaven.

###### 22
For above all the heavens and their angels has thy throne been placed, and thy garments and thy crown which thou shalt see."

###### 23
And I rejoiced with great joy, that those who love the Most High and His Beloved will afterwards ascend thither by the angel of the Holy Spirit.

###### 24
And he raise me to the third heaven, and in like manner I saw those upon the right and upon the left, and there was a throne there in the midst; but the memorial of this world is there unheard of.

###### 25
And I said to the angel who was with me; for the glory of my appearance was undergoing transformation as I ascended to each heaven in turn: "Nothing of the vanity of that world is here named."

###### 26
And he answered me, and said unto me: "Nothing is named on account of its weakness, and nothing is hidden there of what is done."

###### 27
And I wished to learn how it is know, and he answered me saying: "When I have raised thee to the seventh heaven whence I was sent, to that which is above these, then thou shalt know that there is nothing hidden from the thrones and from those who dwell in the heavens and from the angels. And the praise wherewith they praised and glory of him who sat on the throne was great, and the glory of the angels on the right hand and on the left was beyond that of the heaven which was below them.

###### 28
And again he raised me to the fourth heaven, and the height from the third to the height from the third to the forth heaven was greater than from the earth to the firmament.

###### 29
And there again I saw those who were on the right hand and those who were on the left, and him who sat on the throne was in the midst, and there also they were praising.

###### 30
And the praise and glory of the angels on the right was greater than that of those on the left.

###### 31
And again the glory of him who sat on the throne was greater than that of the angels on the right, and their glory was beyond that of those who were below.

###### 32
And he raised me to the fifth heaven.

###### 33
And again I saw those upon the right hand and on the left, and him who sat on the throne possessing greater glory that those of the forth heaven.

###### 34
And the glory of those on the right hand was greater than that of those on the left [from the third to the fourth].

###### 35
And the glory of him who was on the throne was greater than that of the angels on the right hand.

###### 36
And their praise was more glorious than that of the fourth heaven.

###### 37
And I praised Him, who is not named and the Only-begotten who dwelleth in the heavens, whose name is not known to any flesh, who has bestowed such glory on the several heaves, and who makes great the glory of the angels, and more excellent the glory of Him who sitteth on the throne.
