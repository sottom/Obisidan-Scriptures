###### 1
After this I saw, and the angel who spoke with me, who conducted me, said unto me: "Understand, Isaiah son of Amoz; for for this purpose have I been sent from God."

###### 2
And I indeed saw a woman of the family of David the prophet, named Mary, and Virgin, and she was espoused to a man named Joseph, a carpenter, and he also was of the seed and family of the righteous David of Bethlehem Judah.

###### 3
And he came into his lot. And when she was espoused, she was found with child, and Joseph the carpenter was desirous to put her away.

###### 4
But the angel of the Spirit appeared in this world, and after that Joseph did not put her away, but kept Mary and did not reveal this matter to any one.

###### 5
And he did not approach May, but kept her as a holy virgin, though with child.

###### 6
And he did not live with her for two months.

###### 7
And after two months of days while Joseph was in his house, and Mary his wife, but both alone.

###### 8
It came to pass that when they were alone that Mary straight-way looked with her eyes and saw a small babe, and she was astonished.

###### 9
And after she had been astonished, her womb was found as formerly before she had conceived.

###### 10
And when her husband Joseph said unto her: "What has astonished thee?" his eyes were opened and he saw the infant and praised God, because into his portion God had come.

###### 11
And a voice came to them: "Tell this vision to no one."

###### 12
And the story regarding the infant was noised broad in Bethlehem.

###### 13
Some said: "The Virgin Mary hath borne a child, before she was married two months."

###### 14
And many said: "She has not borne a child, nor has a midwife gone up (to her), nor have we heard the cries of (labour) pains." And they were all blinded respecting Him and they all knew regarding Him, though they knew not whence He was.

###### 15
And they took Him, and went to Nazareth in Galilee.

###### 16
And I saw, O Hezekiah and Josab my son, and I declare to the other prophets also who are standing by, that (this) hath escaped all the heavens and all the princes and all the gods of this world.

###### 17
And I saw: In Nazareth He sucked the breast as a babe and as is customary in order that He might not be recognized.

###### 18
And when He had grown up he worked great signs and wonders in the land of Israel and of Jerusalem.

###### 19
And after this the adversary envied Him and roused the children of Israel against Him, not knowing who He was, and they delivered Him to the king, and crucified Him, and He descended to the angel (of Sheol).

###### 20
In Jerusalem indeed I was Him being crucified on a tree:

###### 21
And likewise after the third day rise again and remain days.

###### 22
And the angel who conducted me said: "Understand, Isaiah": and I saw when He sent out the Twelve Apostles and ascended.

###### 23
And I saw Him, and He was in the firmament, but He had not changed Himself into their form, and all the angels of the firmament and the Satans saw Him and they worshipped.

###### 24
And there was much sorrow there, while they said: "How did our Lord descend in our midst, and we perceived not the glory [which has been upon Him], which we see has been upon Him from the sixth heaven?"

###### 25
And He ascended into the second heaven, and He did not transform Himself, but all the angels who were on the right and on the left and the throne in the midst.

###### 26
Both worshipped Him and praised Him and said: "How did our Lord escape us whilst descending, and we perceived not?"

###### 27
And in like manner He ascended into the third heaven, and they praised and said in like manner.

###### 28
And in the fourth heaven and in the fifth also they said precisely after the same manner.

###### 29
But there was one glory, and from it He did not change Himself.

###### 30
And I saw when He ascended into the sixth heaven, and they worshipped and glorified Him.

###### 31
But in all the heavens the praise increased (in volume).

###### 32
And I saw how He ascended into the seventh heaven, and all the righteous and all the angels praised Him. And then I saw Him sit down on the right hand of that Great Glory whose glory I told you that I could not behold.

###### 33
And also the angel of the Holy Spirit I saw sitting on the left hand.

###### 34
And this angel said unto me: "Isaiah, son of Amoz, it is enough for thee;... for thou hast seen what no child of flesh has seen.

###### 35
And thou wilt return into thy garment (of the flesh) until thy days are completed. Then thou wilt come hither."

###### 36
These things Isaiah saw and told unto all that stood before him, and they praised. And he spake to Hezekiah the King and said: "I have spoken these things."

###### 37
Both the end of this world;

###### 38
And all this vision will be consummated in the last generations.

###### 39
And Isaiah made him swear that he would not tell (it) to the people of Israel, nor give these words to any man to transcribe.

###### 40
...such things ye will read. and watch ye in the Holy Spirit in order they ye may receive your garments and thrones and crowns of glory which are laid up in the seventh heaven.

###### 41
On account of these visions and prophecies Sammael Satan sawed in sunder Isaiah the son of Amoz, the prophet, by the hand of Manasseh.

###### 42
And all these things Hezekiah delivered to Manasseh in the twenty-sixth year.

###### 43
But Manasseh did not remember them nor place these things in his heart, but becoming the servant of Satan he was destroyed. Here endeth the vision of Isaiah the prophet with his ascension.
