###### 1
AND now, my children, I command you, love Levi, that ye may abide, and exalt not yourselves against him, lest ye be utterly destroyed.

###### 2
For to me the Lord gave the kingdom, and to him the priesthood, and He set the kingdom beneath the priesthood.

###### 3
To me He gave the things upon the earth; to him the things in the heavens.

###### 4
As the heaven is higher than the earth, so is the priesthood of God higher than the earthly kingdom, unless it falls away through sin from the Lord and is dominated by the earthly kingdom.

###### 5
For the angel of the Lord said unto me: The Lord chose him rather than thee, to draw near to Him, and to eat of His table and to offer Him the first-fruits of the choice things of the sons of Israel; but thou shalt be king of Jacob.

###### 6
And thou shalt be amongst them as the sea.

###### 7
For as, on the sea, just and unjust are tossed about, some taken into captivity while some are enriched, so also shall every race of men be in thee: some shall be impoverished, being taken captive, and others grow rich by plundering the possessions of others.

###### 8
For the kings shall be as sea-monsters.

###### 9
They shall swallow men like fishes: the sons and daughters of freemen shall they enslave; houses, lands, flocks, money shall they plunder:

###### 10
And with the flesh of many shall they wrongfully feed the ravens and the cranes; and they shall advance in evil in covetousness uplifted, and there shall be false prophets like tempest, and they shall persecute all righteous men.

###### 11
And the Lord shall bring upon them divisions one against another.

###### 12
And there shall be continual wars in Israel; and among men of another race shall my kingdom be brought to an end, until the salvation of Israel shall come.

###### 13
Until the appearing of the God of righteousness, that Jacob, and all the Gentiles may rest in peace.

###### 14
And He shall guard the might of my kingdom for ever; for the Lord aware to me with an oath that He would not destroy the kingdom from my seed for ever.

###### 15
Now I have much grief, my children, because of your lewdness and witchcrafts, and idolatries which ye shall practise against the kingdom, following them that have familiar spirits, diviners, and demons of error.

###### 16
Ye shall make your daughters singing girls and harlots, and ye shall mingle in the abominations of the Gentiles.

###### 17
For which things' sake the Lord shall bring upon you famine and pestilence, death and the sword, beleaguering by enemies, and revilings of friends, the slaughter of children, the rape of wives, the plundering of possessions, the burning of the temple of God, the laying waste of the land, the enslavement of yourselves among the Gentiles.

###### 18
And they shall make some of you eunuchs for their wives.

###### 19
Until the Lord visit you, when with perfect heart ye repent and walk in all His commandments, and He bring you up from captivity among the Gentiles.

###### 20
And after these things shall a star arise to you from Jacob in peace,

###### 21
And a man shall arise from my seed, like the sun of righteousness,

###### 22
Walking with the sons of men in meekness and righteousness;

###### 23
And no sin shall be found in him.

###### 24
And the heavens shall be opened unto him, to pour out the spirit, even the blessing of the Holy Father; and He shall pour out the spirit of grace upon you;

###### 25
And ye shall be unto Him sons in truth, and ye shall walk in His commandments first and last.

###### 26
Then shall the sceptre of my kingdom shine forth; and from your root shall arise a stem; and from it shall grow a rod of righteousness to the Gentiles, to judge and to save all that call upon the Lord.

###### 27
And after these things shall Abraham and Isaac and Jacob arise unto life; and I and my brethren shall be chiefs of the tribes of Israel:

###### 28
Levi first, I the second, Joseph third, Benjamin fourth, Simeon fifth, Issachar sixth, and so all in order.

###### 29
And the Lord blessed Levi, and the Angel of the Presence, me; the powers of glory, Simeon; the heaven, Reuben; the earth, Issachar; the sea, Zebulun; the mountains, Joseph; the tabernacle, Benjamin; the luminaries, Dan; Eden, Naphtali; the sun, Gad; the moon, Asher.

###### 30
And ye shall be the people of the Lord, and have one tongue; and there shall be there no spirit of deceit of Beliar, for he shall be cast into the fire for ever.

###### 31
And they who have died in grief shall arise in joy, and they who were poor for the Lord's sake shall be made rich, and they who are put to death for the Lord's sake shall awake to life.

###### 32
And the harts of Jacob shall run in joyfulness, and the eagles of Israel shall fly in gladness; and all the people shall glorify the Lord for ever.

###### 33
Observe, therefore, my children, all the law of the Lord, for there is hope for all them who hold fast unto, His ways.

###### 34
And he said to them: Behold, I die before your eyes this day, a hundred and nineteen years old.

###### 35
Let no one bury me in costly apparel, nor tear open my bowels, for this shall they who are kings do; and carry me up to Hebron with you.

###### 36
And Judah, when he had said these things, fell asleep; and his sons did according to all whatsoever he commanded them, and they buried him in Hebron, with his fathers.
