###### 1
AND eighteen years my father abode in peace with his brother Esau, and his sons with us, after that we came from Mesopotamia, from Laban.

###### 2
And when eighteen years were fulfilled, in the fortieth year of my life, Esau, the brother of my father, came upon us with a mighty and strong people.

###### 3
And Jacob smote Esau with an arrow, and he was taken up wounded on Mount Seir, and as he went he died at Anoniram.

###### 4
And we pursued after the sons of Esau.

###### 5
Now they had a city with walls of iron and gates of brass; and we could not enter into it, and we encamped around, and besieged it.

###### 6
And when they opened not to us in twenty days, I set up a ladder in the sight of all and with my shield upon my head I went up, sustaining the assault of stones, upwards of three talents weight; and I slew four of their mighty men.

###### 7
And Reuben and Gad slew six others.

###### 8
Then they asked from us terms of peace; and having taken counsel with our father, we received them as tributaries.

###### 9
And they gave us five hundred cors of wheat, five hundred baths of oil, five hundred measures of wine, until the famine, when we went down into Egypt.

###### 10
And after these things my son Er took to wife Tamar, from Mesopotamia, a daughter of Aram.

###### 11
Now Er was wicked, and he was in need concerning Tamar, because she was not of the land of Canaan.

###### 12
And on the third night an angel of the Lord smote him.

###### 13
And he had not known her according to the evil craftiness of his mother, for he did not wish to have children by her.

###### 14
In the days of the wedding feast I gave Onan to her in marriage; and he also in wickedness knew her not, though he spent with her a year.

###### 15
And when I threatened him he went in unto her, but he spilled the seed on the ground, according to the command of his mother, and he also died through wickedness.

###### 16
And I wished to give Shelah also to her, but his mother did not permit it; for she wrought evil against Tamar, because she was not the daughters of Canaan, as she also herself was.

###### 17
And I knew that the race of the Canaanites was wicked, but the impulse of youth blinded my mind.

###### 18
And when I saw her pouring out wine, owing to the intoxication of wine I was deceived, and took her although my father had not counselled it.

###### 19
And while I was away she went and took for Shelah a wife from Canaan.

###### 20
And when I knew what she had done, I cursed her in the anguish of my soul.

###### 21
And she also died through her wickedness together with her sons.

###### 22
And after these things, while Tamar was a widow, she heard after two years that I was going up, to shear my sheep, and adorned herself in bridal array, and sat in the city Enaim by the gate.

###### 23
For it was a law of the Amorites, that she who was about to marry should sit in fornication seven days by the gate.

###### 24
Therefore being drunk with wine, I did not recognize her; and her beauty deceived me, through the fashion of her adorning.

###### 25
And I turned aside to her, and said: Let me go in unto thee.

###### 26
And she said: What wilt thou give me? And I gave her my staff, and my girdle, and the diadem of my kingdom in pledge.

###### 27
And I went in unto her, and she conceived.

###### 28
And not knowing what I had done, I wished to slay her; but she privily sent my pledges, and put me to shame.

###### 29
And when I called her, I heard also the secret words which I spoke when lying with her in my drunkenness; and I could not slay her, because it was from the Lord.

###### 30
For I said, Lest haply she did it in subtlety, having received the pledge from another woman.

###### 31
But I came not again near her while I lived, because I had done this abomination in all Israel.

###### 32
Moreover, they who were in the city said there was no harlot in the gate, because she came from another place, and sat for a while in the gate.

###### 33
And I thought that no one knew that I had gone in to her.

###### 34
And after this we came into Egypt to Joseph, because of the famine.

###### 35
And I was forty and six years old, and seventy and three years lived I in Egypt.
