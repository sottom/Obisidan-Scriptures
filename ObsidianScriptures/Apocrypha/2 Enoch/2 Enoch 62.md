###### 1
Blessed is the man who in his patience brings his gifts with faith before the Lordâ€™s face, because he will find forgiveness of sins.

###### 2
But if he take back his words before the time, there is no repentance for him; and if the time pass and he do not of his own will what is promised, there is no repentance after death.

###### 3
Because every work which man does before the time, is all deceit before men, and sin before God.
