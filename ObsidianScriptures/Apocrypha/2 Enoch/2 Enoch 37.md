###### 1
And the Lord called upon one of the older angels, terrible and menacing, and placed him by me, in appearance white as snow, and his hands like ice, having the appearance of great frost, and he froze my face, because I could not endure the terror of the Lord, just as it is not possible to endure A stove’s fire and the sun’s heat, and the frost of the air.

###### 2
And the Lord said to me: Enoch, if your face be not frozen here, no man will be able to behold your face.
