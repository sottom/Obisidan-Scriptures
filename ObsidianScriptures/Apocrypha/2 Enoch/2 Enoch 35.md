###### 1
Behold from their seed shall arise another generation, much afterwards, but of them many will be very insatiate.

###### 2
He who raises that generation, (shall) reveal to them the books of your handwriting, of your fathers, (to them) to whom he must point out the guardianship of the world, to the faithful men and workers of my pleasure, who do not acknowledge my name in vain.

###### 3
And they shall tell another generation, and those (others) having read shall be glorified thereafter, more than the first.
