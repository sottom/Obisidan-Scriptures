###### 1
Now, Enoch, I give you the term of thirty days to spend in your house, and tell your sons and all your household, that all may hear from my face what is told them by you, that they may read and understand, how there is no other God but me.

###### 2
And that they may always keep my commandments, and begin to read and take in the books of your handwriting.

###### 3
And after thirty days I shall send my angel for you, and he will take you from earth and from your sons to me.
