###### 1
When Enoch had spoken these words to his sons, all people far and near heard how the Lord was calling Enoch. They took counsel together:

###### 2
Let us go and kiss Enoch, and two thousand men came together and came to the place Achuzan where Enoch was, and his sons.

###### 3
And the elders of the people, the whole assembly, came and bowed down and began to kiss Enoch and said to him:

###### 4
Our father Enoch, (may) you (be) blessed of the Lord, the eternal ruler, and now bless your sons and all the people, that we may be glorified to-day before your face.

###### 5
For you shalt be glorified before the Lordâ€™s face for all time, since the Lord chose you, rather than all men on earth, and designated you writer of all his creation, visible (physical) and invisible (spiritual), and redeemed of the sins of man, and helper of your household.
