###### 1
He who works the killing of a manâ€™s soul, kills his own soul, and kills his own body, and there is no cure for him for all time.

###### 2
He who puts a man in any snare, shall stick in it himself, and there is no cure for him for all time.

###### 3
He who puts a man in any vessel, his retribution will not be wanting at the great judgment for all time.

###### 4
He who works crookedly or speaks evil against any soul, will not make justice for himself for all time.
