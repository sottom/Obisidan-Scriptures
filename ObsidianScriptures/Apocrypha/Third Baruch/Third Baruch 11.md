###### 1
And the angel took me and led me thence to a fifth heaven. And the gate was closed.

###### 2
And I said, Lord, is not this gate-way open that we may enter? And the angel said to me, We cannot enter until Michael comes, who holds the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven; but wait and thou shalt see the glory of God.

###### 3
And there was a great sound, as thunder. And I said, Lord, what is this sound?

###### 4
And he said to me, Even now Michael, the commander of the angels, comes down to receive the prayers of men. And behold a voice came, Let the gates be opened.

###### 5
And they opened them, and there was a roar as of thunder.

###### 6
And Michael came, and the angel who was with me came face to face with him and said, Hail, my commander, and that of all our order.

###### 7
And the commander Michael said, Hail thou also, our brother, and the interpreter of the revelations to those who pass through life virtuously.

###### 8
And having saluted one another thus, they stood still. And I saw the commander Michael, holding an exceedingly great vessel; its depth was as great as the distance from heaven to earth, and its breadth as great as the distance from north to south. And I said, Lord, what is that which Michael the archangel is holding?

###### 9
And he said to me, This is where the merits of the righteous enter, and such good works as they do, which are escorted before the heavenly God.
