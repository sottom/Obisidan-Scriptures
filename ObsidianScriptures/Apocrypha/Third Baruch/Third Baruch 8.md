###### 1
And he took me and led me towards the west; and when the time of the, setting came,

###### 2
I saw again the bird coming before it, and as soon as lie came I saw the angels, and they lifted the crown from its head.

###### 3
But the bird stood exhausted and with wings contracted.

###### 4
And beholding these things, I said, Lord, wherefore did they lift the crown from the head of the sun,and wherefore is the bird so exhausted?

###### 5
And the angel said to me, The crown of the sun, when it has run through the day, four angels take it, and bear it up to heaven, and renew it, because it and its rays have been defiled upon earth; moreover it is so renewed each day.

###### 6
And I Baruch said, Lord, and wherefore are its beams defiled upon earth? And the angel said to me, Because it beholds the lawlessness and unrighteousness of men, namely fornications, adulteries, thefts, extortions, idolatries, drunkenness, murders, strife, jealousies, evil-speakings, murmurings, whisperings, divinations, and such like, which are not well-pleasing to God. On account of these things is it defiled, and therefore is it renewed.

###### 7
But thou askest concerning the bird, how it is exhausted. Because by restraining the rays of the sun through the fire and burning heat of the whole day, it is exhausted thereby. For, as we said before, unless his wings were screening the rays of the sun, no living creature would be preserved.
