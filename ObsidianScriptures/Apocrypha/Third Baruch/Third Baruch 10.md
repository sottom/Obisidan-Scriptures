###### 1
And when I had learnt all these things from the archangel, he took and led me into a fourth heaven.

###### 2
And I saw a monotonous plain, and in the middle of it a pool of water.

###### 3
And there were in it multitudes of birds of all kinds, but not like those here on earth.

###### 4
But I saw a crane as great as great oxen; and all the birds were great beyond those in the world.

###### 5
And I asked the angel, What is the plain, and what the pool, and what the multitudes of birds around it?

###### 6
And the angel said, Listen, Baruch : The plain which contains in it the pool and other wonders is the place where the souls of the righteous come, when they hold converse, living together in choirs. But the water is that which the clouds receive, and rain upon the earth, and the fruits increase.

###### 7
And I said again to the angel of the Lord, But (what) are these birds? And he said to me, They are those which continually sing praise to the Lord.

###### 8
And I said, Lord, and how do men say that the water which descends in rain is from the sea?

###### 9
And the angel said, The water which descends in rain -- this also is from the sea, and from the waters upon earth; but that which stimulates the fruits is (only) from the latter source.

###### 10
Know therefore henceforth that from this source is what is called the dew of heaven.
