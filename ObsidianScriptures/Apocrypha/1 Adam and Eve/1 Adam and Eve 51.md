###### 1
When Adam heard these words from God, he took Eve and went from the
northern end of the garden to the south of it, by the river of water
where they once fasted.

###### 2
But as they were going on their way, and before they got there,
Satan, the wicked one, had heard the Word of God communing with Adam
respecting his covering.

###### 3
It grieved him, and he hastened to the place where the sheep-skins
were, with the intention of taking them and throwing them into the sea,
or of burning them with fire, so that Adam and Eve would not find them.

###### 4
But as he was about to take them, the Word of God came from heaven,
and bound him by the side of those skins until Adam and Eve came near
him.  But as they got closer to him they were afraid of him, and of his
hideous look.

###### 5
Then came the Word of God to Adam and Eve, and said to them, "This is
he who was hidden in the serpent, and who deceived you, and stripped
you of the garment of light and glory in which you were.

###### 6
This is he who promised you majesty and divinity.  Where, then, is
the beauty that was on him?  Where is his divinity?  Where is his
light?  Where is the glory that rested on him?

###### 7
Now his figure is hideous; he is become abominable among angels; and
he has come to be called Satan.

###### 8
O Adam, he wished to take from you this earthly garment of
sheep-skins, and to destroy it, and not let you be covered with it.

###### 9
What, then, is his beauty that you should have followed him?  And
what have you gained by obeying him?  See his evil works and then look
at Me; at Me, your Creator, and at the good deeds I do you.

###### 10
See, I bound him until you came and saw him and beheld his weakness,
that no power is left with him."

###### 11
And God released him from his bonds.
