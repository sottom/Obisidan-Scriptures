###### 1
Then Adam and Eve went in search of the garden.

###### 2
And the heat beat like a flame on their faces; and they sweated from
the heat, and cried before the Lord.

###### 3
But the place where they cried was close to a high mountain, facing
the western gate of the garden.

###### 4
Then Adam threw himself down from the top of that mountain; his face
was torn and his flesh was ripped; he lost a lot of blood and was close
to death.

###### 5
Meanwhile Eve remained standing on the mountain crying over him, thus
lying.

###### 6
And she said, "I don't wish to live after him; for all that he did to
himself was through me."

###### 7
Then she threw herself after him; and was torn and ripped by stones;
and remained lying as dead.

###### 8
But the merciful God, who looks over His creatures, looked at Adam
and Eve as they lay dead, and He sent His Word to them, and raised them.

###### 9
And said to Adam, "O Adam, all this misery which you have brought on
yourself, will have no affect against My rule, neither will it alter
the covenant of the 5, 500 years."
