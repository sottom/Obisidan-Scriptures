After these things, God commanded the angel Gabriel to go down to the
garden, and say to the cherub who kept it, "Behold, God has commanded
me to come into the garden, and to take from it sweet smelling incense,
and give it to Adam."

Then the angel Gabriel went down by God's order to the garden, and
told the cherub as God had commanded him.

The cherub then said, "Well."  And Gabriel went in and took the
incense.

speak to the cherub about some myrrh, to give to Adam.

The golden rods were from the Indian sea, where there are precious
stones.  The incense was from the eastern border of the garden; and the
myrrh from the western border, from where bitterness came over Adam.

And the angels brought these things to God, by the Tree of Life, in
the garden.

Then God said to the angels, "Dip them in the spring of water; then
take them and sprinkle their water over Adam and Eve, that they be a
little comforted in their sorrow, and give them to Adam and Eve.

And the angels did as God had commanded them, and they gave all those
things to Adam and Eve on the top of the mountain on which Satan had
placed them, when he sought to make an end of them.

###### 10
And when Adam saw the golden rods, the incense and the myrrh, he was
rejoiced and cried because he thought that the gold was a token of the
kingdom from where he had come, that the incense was a token of the
bright light which had been taken from him, and that the myrrh was a
token of the sorrow in which he was.
