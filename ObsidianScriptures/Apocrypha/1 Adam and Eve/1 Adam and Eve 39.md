###### 1
Then Adam returned to Eve, and said to her, "Get up, and take a fig
for yourself, and I will take another; and let us go to our cave."

###### 2
Then Adam and Eve took each a fig and went towards the cave; the time
was about the setting of the sun; and their thoughts made them long to
eat of the fruit.

###### 3
But Adam said to Eve, "I am afraid to eat of this fig.  I know not
what may come over me from it."

###### 4
So Adam cried, and stood praying before God, saying, "Satisfy my
hunger, without my having to eat this fig; for after I have eaten it,
what will it profit me?  And what shall I desire and ask of you, O God,
when it is gone?"

###### 5
And he said again, "I am afraid to eat of it; for I know not what
will befall me through it."
