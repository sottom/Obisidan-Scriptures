###### 1
But Adam and Eve cried before God.  And Adam said to Him:--

###### 2
"O Lord, when I was in the cave, I said this to you, my Lord, the
beasts of the field would rise and devour me, and cut off my life from
the earth."

###### 3
Then Adam, because of what had happened to him, beat his chest and
fell on the ground like a corpse.  Then the Word of God came to him,
who raised him, and said to him,

###### 4
"O Adam, not one of these beasts will be able to hurt you; because I
have made the beasts and other moving things come to you in the cave.
I did not let the serpent come with them because it might have risen
against you and made you tremble; and the fear of it should fall into
your hearts.

###### 5
For I knew that the accursed one is wicked; therefore I would not let
it come near you with the other beasts.

###### 6
But now strengthen your heart and fear not.  I am with you to the end
of the days I have determined on you."
