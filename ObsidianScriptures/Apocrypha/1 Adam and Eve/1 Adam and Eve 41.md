###### 1
Then Adam took the fig, and laid it on the golden rods.  Eve also
took her fig, and put it on the incense.

###### 2
And the weight of each fig was that of a water-melon; for the fruit
of the garden was much larger than the fruit of this land.

###### 3
But Adam and Eve remained standing and fasting the whole of that
night, until the morning dawned.

###### 4
When the sun rose they were still praying, but after they had
finished praying, Adam said to Eve:--

###### 5
"O Eve, come, let us go to the border of the garden looking south; to
the place from where the river flows, and is parted into four heads.
There we will pray to God, and ask Him to give us some of the Water of
Life to drink.

###### 6
For God has not fed us with the Tree of Life, in order that we may
not live.  Therefore, we will ask him to give us some of the Water of
Life, and to quench our thirst with it, rather than with a drink of
water of this land."

###### 7
When Eve heard these words from Adam, she agreed; and they both got
up and came to the southern border of the garden, at the edge of the
river of water a short distance from the garden.

###### 8
And they stood and prayed before the Lord, and asked Him to look at
them this once, to forgive them, and to grant them their request.

###### 9
After this prayer from both of them, Adam began to pray with his
voice before God, and said;--

###### 10
"O Lord, when I was in the garden and saw the water that flowed from
under the Tree of Life, my heart did not desire, neither did my body
require to drink of it; neither did I know thirst, for I was living;
and above that which I am now.

###### 11
So that in order to live I did not require any Food of Life, neither
did I drink of the Water of Life.

###### 12
But now, O God, I am dead; my flesh is parched with thirst.  Give me
of the Water of Life that I may drink of it and live.

###### 13
Of Your mercy, O God, save me from these plagues and trials, and
bring me into another land different from this, if You will not let me
live in Your garden."
