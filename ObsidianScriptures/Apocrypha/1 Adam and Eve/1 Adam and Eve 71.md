###### 1
But when Adam heard these words from Satan, he sorrowed much, because
of his oath and of his promise, and said, "Shall I commit adultery with
my flesh and my bones, and shall I sin against myself, for God to
destroy me, and to blot me out from off the face of the earth?

###### 2
Since, when at first, I ate of the tree, He drove me out of the
garden into this strange land, and deprived me of my bright nature, and
brought death over me.  If, then, I should do this, He will cut off my
life from the earth, and He will cast me into hell, and will plague me
there a long time.

###### 3
But God never spoke the words that you have said; and you are not
God's angels, and you weren't sent from Him.  But you are devils that
have come to me under the false appearance of angels.  Away from me;
you cursed of God!"

###### 4
Then those devils fled from before Adam.  And he and Eve got up, and
returned to the Cave of Treasures, and went into it.

###### 5
Then Adam said to Eve, "If you saw what I did, don't tell anyone; for
I sinned against God in swearing by His great name, and I have placed
my hand another time into that of Satan."  Eve, then, held her peace,
as Adam told her.

###### 6
Then Adam got up, and spread his hands before God, beseeching and
entreating Him with tears, to forgive him what he had done.  And Adam
remained thus standing and praying forty days and forty nights.  He
neither ate nor drank until he dropped down on the ground from hunger
and thirst.

###### 7
Then God sent His Word to Adam, who raised him up from where he lay,
and said to him, "O Adam, why have you sworn by My name, and why have
you made agreement with Satan another time?"

###### 8
But Adam cried, and said, "O God, forgive me, for I did this
unwittingly; believing they were God's angels."

###### 9
And God forgave Adam, saying to him, "Beware of Satan."

###### 10
And He withdrew His Word from Adam.

###### 11
Then Adam's heart was comforted; and he took Eve, and they went out
of the cave, to prepare some food for their bodies.

###### 12
But from that day Adam struggled in his mind about his marrying Eve;
afraid that if he was to do it, God would be angry with him.

###### 13
Then Adam and Eve went to the river of water, and sat on the bank,
as people do when they enjoy themselves.

###### 14
But Satan was jealous of them; and planned to destroy them.
