###### 1
Then Adam said to God, "I dry up in the heat, I am faint from
walking, and I don't want to be in this world.  And I don't know when
You will take me out of it to rest."

###### 2
Then the Lord God said to him, "O Adam, it cannot be now, not until
you have ended your days.  Then shall I bring you out of this miserable
land."

###### 3
And Adam said to God, "While I was in the garden I knew neither heat,
nor languor, neither moving about, nor trembling, nor fear; but now
since I came to this land, all this affliction has come over me.

###### 4
Then God said to Adam, "So long as you were keeping My commandment,
My light and My grace rested on you.  But when you transgressed My
commandment, sorrow and misery came to you in this land."

###### 5
And Adam cried and said, "O Lord, do not cut me off for this, neither
punish me with heavy plagues, nor yet repay me according to my sin; for
we, of our own will, transgressed Your commandment, and ignored Your
law, and tried to become gods like you, when Satan the enemy deceived
us."

###### 6
Then God said again to Adam, "Because you have endured fear and
trembling in this land, languor and suffering, treading and walking
about, going on this mountain, and dying from it, I will take all this
on Myself in order to save you."
