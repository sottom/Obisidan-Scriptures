###### 1
After these things God said to Adam, "You asked Me for something from
the garden, to be comforted therewith, and I have given you these three
tokens as a consolation to you; that you trust in Me and in My covenant
with you.

###### 2
For I will come and save you; and kings shall bring me when in the
flesh, gold, incense and myrrh; gold as a token of My kingdom; incense
as a token of My divinity; and myrrh as a token of My suffering and of
My death.

###### 3
But, O Adam, put these by you in the cave; the gold that it may shed
light over you by night; the incense, that you smell its sweet savor;
and the myrrh, to comfort you in your sorrow."

###### 4
When Adam heard these words from God, he worshipped before Him.  He
and Eve worshipped Him and gave Him thanks, because He had dealt
mercifully with them.

###### 5
Then God commanded the three angels, Michael, Gabriel and Raphael,
each to bring what he had brought, and give it to Adam.  And they did
so, one by one.

###### 6
And God commanded Suriyel and Salathiel to bear up Adam and Eve, and
bring them down from the top of the high mountain, and to take them to
the Cave of Treasures.

###### 7
There they laid the gold on the south side of the cave, the incense
on the eastern side, and the myrrh on the western side.  For the mouth
of the cave was on the north side.

###### 8
The angels then comforted Adam and Eve, and departed.

###### 9
The gold was seventy rods; the incense, twelve pounds; and the
myrrh, three pounds.

###### 10
These remained by Adam in the Cave of Treasures.

###### 11
God gave these three things to Adam on the third day after he had
come out of the garden, in token of the three days the Lord should
remain in the heart of the earth.

###### 12
And these three things, as they continued with Adam in the cave,
gave him light by night; and by day they gave him a little relief from
his sorrow.
