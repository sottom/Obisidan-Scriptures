###### 1
Then the Word of God came and said:--

###### 2
"O Adam, who counselled you, when you came out of the cave, to come
to this place?"

###### 3
And Adam said to God, "O Lord, we came to this place because of the
heat of the fire, that came over us inside the cave."

###### 4
Then the Lord God said to Adam, "O Adam, you dread the heat of fire
for one night, but how will it be when you live in hell?

###### 5
Yet, O Adam, don't be afraid, and don't believe that I have placed
this dome of rock over you to plague you with it.

###### 6
It came from Satan, who had promised you the Godhead and majesty.  It
is he who threw down this rock to kill you under it, and Eve with you,
and thus to prevent you from living on the earth.

###### 7
But, in mercy for you, just as that rock was falling down on you, I
commanded it to form an dome over you; and the rock under you to lower
itself.

###### 8
And this sign, O Adam, will happen to Me at My coming on earth: Satan
will raise the people of the Jews to put Me to death; and they will lay
Me in a rock, and seal a large stone over Me, and I shall remain within
that rock three days and three nights.

###### 9
But on the third day I shall rise again, and it shall be salvation to
you, O Adam, and to your descendants, to believe in Me.  But, O Adam, I
will not bring you from under this rock until three days and three
nights have passed."

###### 10
And God withdrew His Word from Adam.

###### 11
But Adam and Eve lived under the rock three days and three nights,
as God had told them.

###### 12
And God did so to them because they had left their cave and had come
to  this same place without God's order.

###### 13
But, after three days and three nights, God created an opening in
the dome of rock and allowed them to get out from under it.  Their
flesh was dried up, and their eyes and hearts were troubled from crying
and sorrow.
