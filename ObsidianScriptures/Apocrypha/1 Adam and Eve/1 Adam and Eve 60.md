###### 1
Then on the eighty-ninth day, Satan came to the cave, clad in a
garment of light, and girt about with a bright girdle.

###### 2
In his hands was a staff of light, and he looked most awful; but his
face was pleasant and his speech was sweet.

###### 3
He thus transformed himself in order to deceive Adam and Eve, and to
make them come out of the cave, before they had fulfilled the forty
days.

###### 4
For he said within himself, "Now that when they had fulfilled the
forty days' fasting and praying, God would restore them to their former
state; but if He did not do so, He would still be favorable to them;
and even if He had not mercy on them, would He yet give them something
from the garden to comfort them; as already twice before."

###### 5
Then Satan drew near the cave in this fair appearance, and said:--

###### 6
"O Adam, get up, stand up, you and Eve, and come along with me, to a
good land; and don't be afraid.  I am flesh and bones like you; and at
first I was a creature that God created.

###### 7
And it was so, that when He had created me, He placed me in a garden
in the north, on the border of the world.

###### 8
And He said to me, 'Stay here!'  And I remained there according to
His Word, neither did I transgress His commandment.

###### 9
Then He made a slumber to come over me, and He brought you, O Adam,
out of my side, but did not make you stay with me.

###### 10
But God took you in His divine hand, and placed you in a garden to
the eastward.

###### 11
Then I worried about you, for that while God had taken you out of my
side, He had not let you stay with me.

###### 12
But God said to me: 'Do not worry about Adam, whom I brought out of
your side; no harm will come to him.

###### 13
For now I have brought out of his side a help-meet for him; and I
have given him joy by so doing.'"

###### 14
Then Satan said again, "I did not know how it is you are in this
cave, nor anything about this trial that has come over you--until God
said to me, 'Behold, Adam has transgressed, he whom I had taken out of
your side, and Eve also, whom I took out of his side; and I have driven
them out of the garden; I have made them live in a land of sorrow and
misery, because they transgressed against Me, and have obeyed Satan.
And look, they are in suffering until this day, the eightieth.'

###### 15
Then God said to me, 'Get up, go to them, and make them come to your
place, and suffer not that Satan come near them, and afflict them.  For
they are now in great misery; and lie helpless from hunger.'

###### 16
He further said to me, 'When you have taken them to yourself, give
them to eat of the fruit of the Tree of Life, and give them to drink of
the water of peace; and clothe them in a garment of light, and restore
them to their former state of grace, and leave them not in misery, for
they came from you.  But grieve not over them, nor repent of that which
has come over them.

###### 17
But when I heard this, I was sorry; and my heart could not patiently
bear it for your sake, O my child.

###### 18
But, O Adam, when I heard the name of Satan, I was afraid, and I
said within myself, I will not come out because he might trap me as he
did my children, Adam and Eve.

###### 19
And I said, 'O God, when I go to my children, Satan will meet me in
the way, and war against me, as he did against them.'

###### 20
Then God said to me, 'Fear not; when you find him, hit him with the
staff that is in thine hand, and don't be afraid of him, for you are of
old standing, and he shall not prevail against you.'

###### 21
Then I said, 'O my Lord, I am old, and cannot go.  Send Your angels
to bring them.'

###### 22
But God said to me, 'Angels, verily, are not like them; and they
will not consent to come with them.  But I have chosen you, because
they are your offspring and are like you, and they will listen to what
you say.'

###### 23
God said further to me, 'If you don't have enough strength to walk,
I will send a cloud to carry you and set you down at the entrance of
their cave; then the cloud will return and leave you there.

###### 24
And if they will come with you, I will send a cloud to carry you and
them.'

###### 25
Then He commanded a cloud, and it bear me up and brought me to you;
and then went back.

###### 26
And now, O my children, Adam and Eve, look at my old gray hair and
at my feeble state, and at my coming from that distant place.  Come,
come with me, to a place of rest."

###### 27
Then he began to cry and to sob before Adam and Eve, and his tears
poured on the ground like water.

###### 28
And when Adam and Eve raised their eyes and saw his beard, and heard
his sweet talk, their hearts softened towards him; they obeyed him, for
they believed he was true.

###### 29
And it seemed to them that they were really his offspring, when they
saw that his face was like their own; and they trusted him.
