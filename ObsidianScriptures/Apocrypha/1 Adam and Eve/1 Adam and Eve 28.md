###### 1
But when the crafty Satan saw them, that they were going to the
garden, he gathered together his host, and came in appearance on a
cloud, intent on deceiving them.

###### 2
But when Adam and Eve saw him thus in a vision, they thought they
were angels of God come to comfort them about having left the garden,
or to bring them back again into it.

###### 3
And Adam spread his hands before God, beseeching Him to make him
understand what they were.

###### 4
Then Satan, the hater of all good, said to Adam, "O Adam, I am an
angel of the great God; and, behold the hosts that surround me.

###### 5
God has sent us to take you and bring you to the border of the garden
northwards; to the shore of the clear sea, and bathe you and Eve in it,
and raise you to your former gladness, that you return again to the
garden."

###### 6
These words sank into the heart of Adam and Eve.

###### 7
Yet God withheld His Word from Adam, and did not make him understand
at once, but waited to see his strength; whether he would be overcome
as Eve was when in the garden, or whether he would prevail.

###### 8
Then Satan called to Adam and Eve, and said, "Behold, we go to the
sea of water," and they began to go.

###### 9
And Adam and Eve followed them at some little distance.

###### 10
But when they came to the mountain to the north of the garden, a
very high mountain, without any steps to the top of it, the Devil drew
near to Adam and Eve, and made them go up to the top in reality, and
not in a vision; wishing, as he did, to throw them down and kill them,
and to wipe off their name from the earth; so that this earth should
remain to him and his hosts alone.
