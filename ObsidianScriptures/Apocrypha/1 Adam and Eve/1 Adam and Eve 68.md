###### 1
Then God looked at Adam and Eve, and at what had come over them from
Satan, and how he had made them perish.

###### 2
God, therefore, sent His Word, and raised up Adam and Eve from their
state of death.

###### 3
Then, Adam, when he was raised, said, "O God, You have burnt and
taken from us the corn You have given us, and You have emptied out the
bucket of water.  And You have sent Your angels, who have caused us to
lose our way from the corn field.  Will You make us perish?  If this be
from you, O God, then take away our souls; but punish us not."

###### 4
Then God said to Adam, "I did not burn down the wheat, and I did not
pour the water out of the bucket, and I did not send My angels to lead
you astray.

###### 5
But it is Satan, your master who did it; he to whom you have
subjected yourself; my commandment being meanwhile set aside.  He it
is, who burnt down the corn, and poured out the water, and who has led
you astray; and all the promises he has made you were just a trick, a
deception, and a lie.

###### 6
But now, O Adam, you shall acknowledge My good deeds done to you."

###### 7
And God told His angels to take Adam and Eve, and to bear them up to
the field of wheat, which they found as before, with the bucket full of
water.

###### 8
There they saw a tree, and found on it solid manna; and wondered at
God's power.  And the angels commanded them to eat of the manna when
they were hungry.

###### 9
And God admonished Satan with a curse, not to come again, and destroy
the field of corn.

###### 10
Then Adam and Eve took of the corn, and made of it an offering, and
took it and offered it up on the mountain, the place where they had
offered up their first offering of blood.

###### 11
And they offered this offering again on the altar they had built at
first.  And they stood up and prayed, and besought the Lord saying,
"Thus, O God, when we were in the garden,  our praises went up to you,
like this offering; and our innocence went up to you like incense.  But
now, O God, accept this offering from us, and don't turn us away,
deprived of Your mercy."

###### 12
Then God said to Adam and Eve, "Since you have made this offering
and have offered it to Me, I shall make it My flesh, when I come down
on earth to save you; and I shall cause it to be offered continually on
an altar, for forgiveness and for mercy, for those who partake of it
duly."

###### 13
And God sent a bright fire over the offering of Adam and Eve, and
filled it with brightness, grace, and light; and the Holy Ghost came
down on that offering.

###### 14
Then God commanded an angel to take fire tongs, like a spoon, and
with it to take an offering and bring it to Adam and Eve.  And the
angel did so, as God had commanded him, and offered it to them.

###### 15
And the souls of Adam and Eve were brightened, and their hearts were
filled with joy and gladness and with the praises of God.

###### 16
And God said to Adam, "This shall be to  you a custom, to do so,
when affliction and sorrow come over you.  But your deliverance and
your entrance in to the garden, shall not be until the days are
fulfilled as agreed between you and Me; were it not so, I would, of My
mercy and pity for you, bring you back to My garden and to My favor for
the sake of the offering you have just made to My name."

###### 17
Adam rejoiced at these words which he heard from God; and he and Eve
worshipped before the altar, to which they bowed, and then went back to
the Cave of Treasures.

###### 18
And this took place at the end of the twelfth day after the
eightieth day, from the time Adam and Eve came out of the garden.

###### 19
And they stood up the whole night praying until morning; and then
went out of the cave.

###### 20
Then Adam said to Eve, with joy of heart, because of the offering
they had made to God, and that had been accepted of Him, "Let us do
this three times every week, on the fourth day Wednesday, on the
preparation day Friday, and on the Sabbath Sunday, all the days of our
life."

###### 21
And as they agreed to these words between themselves, God was
pleased with their thoughts, and with the resolution they had each
taken with the other.

###### 22
After this, came the Word of God to Adam, and said, "O Adam, you
have determined beforehand the days in which sufferings shall come over
Me, when I am made flesh; for they are the fourth Wednesday, and the
preparation day Friday.

###### 23
But as to the first day, I created in it all things, and I raised
the heavens.  And, again, through My rising again on this day, will I
create joy, and raise them on high, who believe in Me; O Adam, offer
this offering, all the days of your life."

###### 24
Then God withdrew His Word from Adam.

###### 25
But Adam continued to offer this offering thus, every week three
times, until the end of seven weeks.  And on the first day, which is
the fiftieth, Adam made an offering as he was accustomed, and he and
Eve took it and came to the altar before God, as He had taught them.
