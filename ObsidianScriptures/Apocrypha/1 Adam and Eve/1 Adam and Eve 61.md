###### 1
Then he took Adam and Eve by the hand, and began to bring them out of
the cave.

###### 2
But when they had come a little ways out of it, God knew that Satan
had overcome them, and had brought them out before the forty days were
ended, to take them to some distant place, and to destroy them.

###### 3
Then the Word of the Lord God again came and cursed Satan, and drove
him away from them.

###### 4
And God began to speak to Adam and Eve, saying to them, "What made
you come out of the cave, to this place?"

###### 5
Then Adam said to God, "Did you create a man before us?  For when we
were in the cave there suddenly came to us a friendly old man who said
to us, 'I am a messenger from God to you, to bring you back to some
place of rest.'

###### 6
And we believed, O God, that he was a messenger from you; and we came
out with him; and knew not where we should go with him."

###### 7
Then God said to Adam, "See, that is the father of evil arts, who
brought you and Eve out of the Garden of Delights.  And now, indeed,
when he saw that you and Eve both joined together in fasting and
praying, and that you came not out of the cave before the end of the
forty days, he wished to make your purpose vein, to break your mutual
bond; to cut off all hope from you, and to drive you to some place
where he might destroy you.

###### 8
Because he couldn't do anything to you unless he showed himself in
the likeness of you.

###### 9
Therefore he came to you with a face like your own, and began to give
you tokens as if they were all true.

###### 10
But because I am merciful and am favorable to you, I did not allow
him to destroy you; instead I drove him away from you.

###### 11
Now, therefore, O Adam, take Eve, and return to your cave, and
remain in it until the morning after  the fortieth day.  And when you
come out, go towards the eastern gate of the garden."

###### 12
Then Adam and Eve worshipped God, and praised and blessed Him for
the deliverance that had come to them from Him.  And they returned
towards the cave.  This happened in the evening of the thirty-ninth day.

###### 13
Then Adam and Eve stood up and with a fiery passion, prayed to God,
to give them strength; for they had become weak because of  hunger and
thirst and prayer.  But they watched the whole of that night praying,
until morning.

###### 14
Then Adam said to Eve, "Get up, let us go towards the eastern gate
of the garden as God told us."

###### 15
And they said their prayers as they were accustomed to do every day;
and they left the cave to go near to the eastern gate of the garden.

###### 16
Then Adam and Eve stood up and prayed, and appealed to God to
strengthen them, and to send them something to satisfy their hunger.

###### 17
But after they finished their prayers, they were too weak to move.

###### 18
Then came the Word of God again, and said to them, "O Adam, get up,
go and bring the two figs here."

###### 19
Then Adam and Eve got up, and went until they came near to the cave.
