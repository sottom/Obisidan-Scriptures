###### 1
Then God considered the words of Adam that they were true, and that
he could long await His order, respecting the counsel of Satan.

###### 2
And God approved Adam in what he had thought concerning this, and in
the prayer he had offered in His presence; and the Word of God came to
Adam and said to him, "O Adam, if only you had had this caution at
first, before you came out of the garden into this land!"

###### 3
After that, God sent His angel who had brought gold, and the angel
who had brought incense, and the angel who had brought myrrh to Adam,
that they should inform him respecting his marriage to Eve.

###### 4
Then those angels said to Adam, "Take the gold and give it to Eve as
a wedding gift, and promise to marry her; then give her some incense
and myrrh as a present; and be you, you and she, one flesh."

###### 5
Adam obeyed the angels, and took the gold and put it into Eve's bosom
in her garment; and promised to marry her with his hand.

###### 6
Then the angels commanded Adam and Eve to get up and pray forty days
and forty nights; when that was done, then Adam was to have sexual
intercourse with his wife; for then this would be an act pure and
undefiled; so that he would have children who would multiply, and
replenish the face of the earth.

###### 7
Then both Adam and Eve received the words of the angels; and the
angels departed from them.

###### 8
Then Adam and Eve began to fast and pray, until the end of the forty
days; and then they had sexual intercourse, as the angels had told
them.  And from the time Adam left the garden until he wedded Eve, were
two hundred and twenty-three days, that is seven months and thirteen
days.

###### 9
Thus was Satan's war with Adam defeated.
