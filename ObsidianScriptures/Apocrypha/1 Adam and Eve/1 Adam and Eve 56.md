###### 1
Then came the Word of God to Adam, and said to him:--

###### 2
"O Adam, look at that garden of joy and at this earth of toil, and
behold the garden is full of angels, but look at yourself alone on this
earth with Satan whom you obeyed.

###### 3
Yet, if you had submitted, and been obedient to Me, and had kept My
Word, you would be with My angels in My garden.

###### 4
But when you transgressed and obeyed Satan, you became his guests
among his angels, that are full of wickedness; and you came to this
earth, that brings forth to you thorns and thistles.

###### 5
O Adam, ask him who deceived you, to give you the divine nature he
promised you, or to make you a garden as I had made for you; or to fill
you with that same bright nature with which I had filled you.

###### 6
Ask him to make you a body like the one I made you, or to give you a
day of rest as I gave you; or to create within you a reasonable soul,
as I created for you; or to take you from here to some other earth than
this one which I gave you.  But, O Adam, he will not fulfil even one of
the things he told you.

###### 7
Acknowledge, then, My favor towards you, and My mercy on you, My
creature; that I have not avenged you for your transgression against
Me, but in My pity for you I have promised you that at the end of the
great five and a half days I will come and save you."

###### 8
Then God said again to Adam and Eve, "Get up, go down from here,
before the cherub with a sword of fire in his hand destroys you."

###### 9
But Adam's heart was comforted by God's words to him, and he
worshipped before Him.

###### 10
And God commanded His angels to escort Adam and Eve to the cave with
joy, instead of the fear that had come over them.

###### 11
Then the angels took up Adam and Eve, and brought them down from the
mountain by the garden, with songs and psalms, until they arrived at
the cave.  There the angels began to comfort and to strengthen them,
and then departed from them towards heaven, to their Creator, who had
sent them.

###### 12
But after the angels had departed from Adam and Eve, Satan came with
shamefacedness, and stood at the entrance of the cave in which were
Adam and Eve.  He then called to Adam, and said, "O Adam, come, let me
speak to you."

###### 13
Then Adam came out of the cave, thinking he was one of God's angels
that was come to give him some good counsel.
