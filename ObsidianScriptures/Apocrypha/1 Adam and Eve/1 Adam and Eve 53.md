They were not very far from the cave, when Satan came towards them,
and hid himself between them and the cave, under the form of two
ravenous lions three days without food, that came towards Adam and Eve,
as if to break them in pieces and devour them.

###### 2
Then Adam and Eve cried, and prayed God to deliver them from their
paws.

###### 3
Then the Word of God came to them, and drove away the lions from them.

###### 4
And God said to Adam, "O Adam, what do you seek on the western
border?  And why have you left of thine own accord the eastern border,
in which was your living place?

###### 5
Now then, turn back to your cave, and remain in it, so that Satan
won't deceive you or work his purpose over you.

###### 6
For in this western border, O Adam, there will go from you a
descendant, that shall replenish it; and that will defile themselves
with their sins, and with their yielding to the commands of Satan, and
by following his works.

###### 7
Therefore will I bring over them the waters of a flood, and overwhelm
them all.  But I will deliver what is left of the righteous among them;
and I will bring them to a distant land, and the land in which you live
now shall remain desolate and without one inhabitant in it.

###### 8
After God had thus spoken to them, they went back to the Cave of
Treasures.  But their flesh was dried up, and they were weak from
fasting and praying, and from the sorrow they felt at having trespassed
against God.
