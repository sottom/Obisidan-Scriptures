###### 1
Then Adam rose and prayed to God, saying, "See, this fire has
separated us from the cave in which You have commanded us to live; but
now, behold, we cannot go into it."

###### 2
Then God heard Adam, and sent him His Word, that said:--

###### 3
"O Adam, see this fire!  How different the flame and heat thereof are
from the garden of delights and the good things in it!

###### 4
When you were under My control, all creatures yielded to you; but
after you have transgressed My commandment, they all rise over you."

###### 5
God said again to him, "See, O Adam, how Satan has exalted you!  He
has deprived you of the Godhead, and of an exalted state like Me, and
has not kept his word to you; but has, after all, become your enemy.
He is the one who made this fire in which he meant to burn you and Eve.

###### 6
Why, O Adam, has he not kept his agreement with you, not even one
day; but has deprived you of the glory that was on you--when you
yielded to his command?

###### 7
Do you think, Adam, that he loved you when he made this agreement
with you?  Or that he loved you and wished to raise you on high?

###### 8
But no, Adam, he did not do all that out of love to you; but he
wished to make you come out of light into darkness; and from an exalted
state to degradation; from glory to abasement; from joy to sorrow; and
from rest to fasting and fainting."

###### 9
God also said to Adam, "See this fire kindled by Satan around your
cave; see this wonder that surrounds you; and know that it will
encompass about both you and your descendants, when you obey his
command; that he will plague you with fire; and that you will go down
into hell after you are dead.

###### 10
Then you will see the burning of his fire, that will be burning
around you and likewise your descendants.  You will not be delivered
from it until My coming; just like you cannot go into your cave right
now because of the great fire around it; not until My Word comes and
makes a way for you on the day My covenant is fulfilled.

###### 11
There is no way for you at present to come from this life to rest,
not until My Word comes, who is My Word.  Then He will make a way for
you, and you shall have rest." Then God called with His Word to the
fire that burned around the cave, that it split itself in half, until
Adam had gone through it.  Then the fire parted itself by God's order,
and a way was made for Adam.

###### 12
And God withdrew His Word from Adam.
