###### 1
Then God, merciful and gracious, looked at them thus lying in the
water, and close to death, and sent an angel, who brought them out of
the water, and laid them on the seashore as dead.

###### 2
Then the angel went up to God, was welcome, and said, "O God, Your
creatures have breathed their last."

###### 3
Then God sent His Word to Adam and Eve, who raised them from their
death.

###### 4
And Adam said, after he was raised, "O God, while we were in the
garden we did not require, or care for this water; but since we came to
this land we cannot do without it."

###### 5
Then God said to Adam, "While you were under My command and were a
bright angel, you knew not this water.

###### 6
But now that you have transgressed My commandment, you can not do
without water, wherein to wash your body and make it grow; for it is
now like that of beasts, and is in want of water."

###### 7
When Adam and Eve heard these words from God, they cried a bitter
cry; and Adam entreated God to let him return into the garden, and look
at it a second time.

###### 8
But God said to Adam, "I have made you a promise; when that promise
is fulfilled, I will bring you back into the garden, you and your
righteous descendants."

###### 9
And God ceased to commune with Adam.
