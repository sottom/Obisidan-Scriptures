###### 1
Then Adam said to Eve, "Behold the children are grown up; we must
think of finding wives for them."

###### 2
Then Eve answered, "How can we do it?"

###### 3
Then Adam said to her, "We will join Abel's sister in marriage to
Cain, and Cain's sister to Abel.

###### 4
The said Eve to Adam, "I do not like Cain because he is hard-hearted;
but let them stay with us until we offer up to the Lord in their
behalf."

###### 5
And Adam said no more.

###### 6
Meanwhile Satan came to Cain in the figure of a man of the field, and
said to him, "Behold Adam and Eve have taken counsel together about the
marriage of you two; and they have agreed to marry Abel's sister to
you, and your sister to him.

###### 7
But if it was not that I love you, I would not have told you this
thing.  Yet if you will take my advice, and obey me, I will bring to
you on your wedding day beautiful robes, gold and silver in plenty, and
my relations will attend you."

###### 8
Then Cain said with joy, "Where are your relations?"

###### 9
And Satan answered, "My relations are in a garden in the north, where
I once meant to bring your father Adam; but he would not accept my
offer.

###### 10
But you, if you will receive my words and if you will come to me
after your wedding, you shall rest from the misery in which you are;
and you shall rest and be better off than your father Adam."

###### 11
At these words of Satan Cain opened his ears, and leaned towards his
speech.

###### 12
And he did not remain in the field, but he went to Eve, his mother,
and beat her, and cursed her, and said to her, "Why are you planning to
take my sister to wed her to my brother?   Am I dead?"

###### 13
His mother, however, quieted him, and sent him to the field where he
had been.

###### 14
Then when Adam came, she told him of what Cain had done.

###### 15
But Adam grieved and held his peace, and said not a word.

###### 16
Then on the next morning Adam said to Cain his son, "Take of your
sheep, young and good, and offer them up to your God; and I will speak
to your brother, to make to his God an offering of corn."

###### 17
They both obeyed their father Adam, and they took their offerings,
and offered them up on the mountain by the altar.

###### 18
But Cain behaved haughtily towards his brother, and shoved him from
the altar, and would not let him offer up his gift on the altar; but he
offered his own on it, with a proud heart, full of guile, and fraud.

###### 19
But as for Abel, he set up stones that were near at hand, and on
that, he offered up his gift with a heart humble and free from guile.

###### 20
Cain was then standing by the altar on which he had offered up his
gift; and he cried to God to accept his offering; but God did not
accept it from him; neither did a divine fire come down to consume his
offering.

###### 21
But he remained standing over against the altar, out of humor and
meanness, looking towards his brother Abel, to see if God would accept
his offering or not.

###### 22
And Abel prayed to God to accept his offering.  Then a divine fire
came down and consumed his offering.  And God smelled the sweet savor
of his offering; because Abel loved Him and rejoice in Him.

###### 23
And because God was well pleased with him, He sent him an angel of
light in the figure of a man who had partaken of his offering, because
He had smelled the sweet savor of his offering, and they comforted Abel
and strengthened his heart.

###### 24
But Cain was looking on all that took place at his brother's
offering, and was angry because of it.

###### 25
Then he opened his mouth and blasphemed God, because He had not
accepted his offering.

###### 26
But God said to cain, "Why do you look sad?  Be righteous, that I
may accept your offering.  Not against Me have you murmured, but
against yourself.

###### 27
And God said this to Cain in rebuke, and because He abhorred him and
his offering.

###### 28
And Cain came down from the altar, his color changed and with a sad
face, and came to his father and mother and told them all that had
befallen him.  And Adam grieved much because God had not accepted
Cain's offering.

###### 29
But Abel came down rejoicing, and with a gladsome heart, and told
his father and mother how God had accepted his offering.  And they
rejoiced at it and kissed his face.

###### 30
And Abel said to his father, "Because Cain shoved me from the altar,
and would not allow me to offer my gift on it, I made an altar for
myself and offered my gift on it."

###### 31
But when Adam heard this he was very sorry, because it was the altar
he had built at first, and on which he had offered his own gifts.

###### 32
As to Cain, he was so resentful and so angry that he went into the
field, where Satan came to him and said to him, "Since your brother
Abel has taken refuge with your father Adam, because you shoved him
from the altar, they have kissed his face, and they rejoice over him,
far more than over you."

###### 33
When Cain heard these words of  Satan, he was filled with rage; and
he let no one know.  But he was laying wait to kill his brother, until
he brought him into the cave, and then said to him:--

###### 34
"O brother, the country is so beautiful, and there are such
beautiful and pleasurable trees in it, and charming to look at!  But
brother, you have never been one day in the field to take your pleasure
in that place.

###### 35
Today, O, my brother, I very much wish you would come with me into
the field, to enjoy yourself and to bless our fields and our flocks,
for you are righteous, and I love you much, O my brother!  But you have
alienated yourself from me."

###### 36
Then Abel consented to go with his brother Cain into the field.

###### 37
But before going out, Cain said to Abel, "Wait for me, until I fetch
a staff, because of wild beasts."

###### 38
Then Abel stood waiting in his innocence.  But Cain, the forward,
fetched a staff and went out.

###### 39
And they began, Cain and his brother Abel, to walk in the way; Cain
talking to him, and comforting him, to make him forget everything.
