###### 1
Then Adam and Eve stood up in the cave and prayed the whole of that
night until the morning dawned.  And when the sun was risen they both
went out of the cave; their heads were wandering from heaviness of
sorrow and they didn't know where they were going.

###### 2
And they walked in that condition to the southern border of the
garden.  And they began to go up that border until they came to the
eastern border beyond which there was no more land.

###### 3
And the cherub who guarded the garden was standing at the western
gate, and guarding it against Adam and Eve, lest they should suddenly
come into the garden.  And the cherub turned around, as if to put them
to death; according to the commandment God had given him.

###### 4
When Adam and Eve came to the eastern border of the garden--thinking
in their hearts that the cherub was not watching--as they were standing
by the gate as if wishing to go in, suddenly came the cherub with a
flashing sword of fire in his hand; and when he saw them, he went forth
to kill them.  For he was afraid that God would destroy him if they
went into the garden without His order.

###### 5
And the sword of the cherub seemed to shoot flames a distance away
from it.  But when he raised it over Adam and Eve, the flame of the
sword did not flash forth.

###### 6
Therefore the cherub thought that God was favorable to them, and was
bringing them back into the garden.  And the cherub stood wondering.

###### 7
He could not go up to Heaven to determine God's order regarding their
getting into the garden; he therefore continued to stand by them,
unable as he was to part from them; for he was afraid that if  they
should enter the garden without permission, God would destroy him.

###### 8
When Adam and Eve saw the cherub coming towards them with a flaming
sword of fire in his hand, they fell on their faces from fear, and were
as dead.

###### 9
At that time the heavens and the earth shook; and another cherubim
came down from heaven to the cherub who guarded the garden, and saw him
amazed and silent.

###### 10
Then, again, other angels came down close to the place where Adam
and Eve were.  They were divided between joy and sorrow.

###### 11
They were glad, because they thought that God was favorable to Adam,
and wished him to return to the garden; and wished to restore him to
the gladness he once enjoyed.

###### 12
But they sorrowed over Adam, because he was fallen like a dead man,
he and Eve; and they said in their thoughts, "Adam has not died in this
place; but God has put him to death, for his having come to this place,
and wishing to get into the garden without His permission."
