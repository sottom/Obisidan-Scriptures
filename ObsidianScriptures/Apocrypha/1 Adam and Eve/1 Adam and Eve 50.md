###### 1
Then Adam and Eve went forth and came into the Cave of Treasures, and
they stood praying in it the whole of that day, until the evening.

###### 2
And this took place at the end of the fifty days after they had left
the garden.

###### 3
But Adam and Eve rose again and prayed to God in the cave the whole
of that night, and begged for mercy from Him.

###### 4
And when the day dawned, Adam said to Eve, "Come!  Let us go and do
some work for our bodies."

###### 5
So they went out of the cave, and came to the northern border of the
garden, and they looked for something to cover their bodies with.  But
they found nothing, and knew not how to do the work.  Yet their bodies
were stained, and they were speechless from cold and heat.

###### 6
Then Adam stood and asked God to show him something with which to
cover their bodies.

###### 7
Then came the Word of God and said to him, "O Adam, take Eve and come
to the seashore where you fasted before.  There you will find skins of
sheep that were left after lions ate the carcasses.  Take them and make
garments for yourselves, and clothe yourselves with them.
