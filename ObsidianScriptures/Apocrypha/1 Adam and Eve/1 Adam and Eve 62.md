###### 1
But Satan the wicked was envious, because of the consolation God had
given them.

###### 2
So he prevented them, and went into the cave and took the two figs,
and buried them outside the cave, so that Adam and Eve should not find
them.  He also had in his thoughts to destroy them.

###### 3
But by God's mercy, as soon as those two figs were in the ground, God
defeated Satan's counsel regarding them; and made them into two fruit
trees, that overshadowed the cave.  For Satan had buried them on the
eastern side of it.

###### 4
Then when the two trees were grown, and were covered with fruit,
Satan grieved and mourned, and said, "It would have been better to have
left those figs where they were; for now, behold, they have become two
fruit trees, whereof Adam will eat all the days of his life.  Whereas I
had in mind, when I buried them, to destroy them entirely, and to hide
them forever.

###### 5
But God has overturned my counsel; and would not that this sacred
fruit should perish; and He has made plain my intention, and has
defeated the counsel I had formed against His servants."

###### 6
Then Satan went away ashamed because he hadn't thought his plans all
the way through.
