###### 1
When the accursed serpent saw Adam and Eve, it swelled its head,
stood on its tail, and with eyes blood-red, acted like it would kill
them.

###### 2
It made straight for Eve, and ran after her; while Adam standing by,
cried because he had no stick in his hand with which to hit the
serpent, and did not know how to put it to death.

###### 3
But with a heart burning for Eve, Adam approached the serpent, and
held it by the tail; when it turned towards him and said to him:--

###### 4
"O Adam, because of you and of Eve, I am slippery, and go on my
belly."  Then with its great strength, it threw down Adam and Eve and
squeezed them, and tried to kill them.

###### 5
But God sent an angel who threw the serpent away from them, and
raised them up.

###### 6
Then the Word of God came to the serpent, and said to it, "The first
time I made you slick, and made you to go on your belly; but I did not
deprive you of speech.

###### 7
This time, however, you will be mute, and you and your race will
speak no more; because, the first time My creatures were ruined because
of  you, and this time you tried to kill them."

###### 8
Then the serpent was struck mute, and was no longer able to speak.

###### 9
And a wind blew down from heaven by the command of God and carried
away the serpent from Adam and Eve, and threw it on the seashore where
it landed in India.
