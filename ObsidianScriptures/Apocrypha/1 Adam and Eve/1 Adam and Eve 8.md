###### 1
Then Adam cried and said, "O God, when we lived in the garden, and
our hearts were lifted up, we saw the angels that sang praises in
heaven, but now we can't see like we used to; no, when we entered the
cave, all creation became hidden from us."

###### 2
Then God the Lord said to Adam, "When you were under subjection to
Me, you had a bright nature within you, and for that reason could you
see things far away.  But after your transgression your bright nature
was withdrawn from you; and it was not left to you to see things far
away, but only near at hand; after the ability of the flesh; for it is
brutish."

###### 3
When Adam and Eve had heard these words from God, they went their
way; praising and worshipping Him with a sorrowful heart.

###### 4
And God ceased to commune with them.
