###### 1
Then Adam and Eve entered the cave, and stood praying, in their own
tongue, unknown to us, but which they knew well.

###### 2
And as they prayed, Adam raised his eyes and saw the rock and the
roof of the cave that covered him overhead.  This prevented him from
seeing either heaven or God's creatures.  So he cried and beat his
chest hard, until he dropped, and was as dead.

###### 3
And Eve sat crying; for she believed he was dead.

###### 4
Then she got up, spread her hands toward God, appealing to Him for
mercy and pity, and said, "O God, forgive me my sin, the sin which I
committed, and don't remember it against me.

###### 5
For I alone caused Your servant to fall from the garden into this
condemned land; from light into this darkness; and from the house of
joy into this prison.

###### 6
O God, look at this Your servant fallen in this manner, and bring him
back to life, that he may cry and repent of his transgression which he
committed through me.

###### 7
Don't take away his soul right now; but let him live that he may
stand after the measure of his repentance, and do Your will, as before
his death.

###### 8
But if You do not bring him back to life, then, O God, take away my
own soul, that I be like him, and leave me not in this dungeon, one and
alone; for I could not stand alone in this world, but with him only.

###### 9
For You, O God, caused him to fall asleep, and took a bone from his
side, and restored the flesh  in the place of it, by Your divine power.

###### 10
And You took me, the bone, and make me a woman, bright like him,
with heart, reason, and speech; and in flesh, like to his own; and You
made me after the likeness of his looks, by Your mercy and power.

###### 11
O Lord, I and he are one, and You, O God, are our Creator, You are
He who made us both in one day.

###### 12
Therefore, O God, give him life, that he may be with me in this
strange land, while we live in it on account of our transgression.

###### 13
But if You will not give him life, then take me, even me, like him;
that we both may die the same day."

###### 14
And Eve cried bitterly, and fell on our father Adam; from her great
sorrow.
