###### 1
Then the merciful God, good and lover of men, looked at Adam and Eve,
and at their blood, which they had held up as an offering to Him;
without an order from Him for so doing.  But He wondered at them; and
accepted their offerings.

###### 2
And God sent from His presence a bright fire, that consumed their
offering.

###### 3
He smelled the sweet savor of their offering, and showed them mercy.

###### 4
Then came the Word of God to Adam, and said to him, "O Adam, as you
have shed your blood, so will I shed My own blood when I become flesh
of your descendants; and as you died, O Adam, so also will I die.  And
as you built an altar, so also will I make for you an altar of the
earth; and as you offered your blood on it, so also will I offer My
blood on an altar on the earth.

###### 5
And as you sued for forgiveness through that blood, so also will I
make My blood forgiveness of sins, and erase transgressions in it.

###### 6
And now, behold, I have accepted your offering, O Adam, but the days
of the covenant in which I have bound you are not fulfilled.  When they
are fulfilled, then will I bring you back into the garden.

###### 7
Now, therefore, strengthen your heart; and when sorrow comes over
you, make Me an offering, and I will be favorable to you."
