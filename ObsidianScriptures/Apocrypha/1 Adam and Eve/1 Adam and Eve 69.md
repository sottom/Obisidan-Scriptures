###### 1
Then Satan, the hater of all good, envious of Adam and of his
offering through which he found favor with God, hastened and took a
sharp stone from among the sharp iron stones; appeared in the form of a
man, and went and stood by Adam and Eve.

###### 2
Adam was then offering on the altar, and had begun to pray, with his
hands spread before God.

###### 3
Then Satan hastened with the sharp iron stone he had with him, and
with it pierced Adam on the right side, from which flowed blood and
water, then Adam fell on the altar like a corpse.  And Satan fled.

###### 4
Then Eve came, and took Adam and placed him below the altar.  And
there she stayed, crying over him; while a stream of blood flowed from
Adam's side over his offering.

###### 5
But God looked at the death of Adam.  He then sent His Word, and
raised him up and said to him, "Fulfil your offering, for indeed, Adam,
it is worth much, and there is no shortcoming in it."

###### 6
God said further to Adam, "Thus will it also happen to Me, on the
earth, when I shall be pierced and blood and water shall flow from My
side and run over My body, which is the true offering; and which shall
be offered on the altar as a perfect offering."

###### 7
Then God commanded Adam to finish his offering, and when he had ended
it he worshipped before God, and praised Him for the signs He had
showed him.

###### 8
And God healed Adam in one day, which is the end of the seven weeks;
and that is the fiftieth day.

###### 9
Then Adam and Eve returned from the mountain, and went into the Cave
of Treasures, as they were used to do.  This completed for Adam and
Eve, one hundred and forty days since their coming out of the garden.

###### 10
Then they both stood up that night and prayed to God.  And when it
was morning, they went out, and went down westward of the cave, to the
place where their corn was, and there rested under the shadow of a
tree, as they were accustomed.

###### 11
But when there a multitude of beasts came all around them.  It was
Satan's doing, in his wickedness; in order to wage war against Adam
through marriage.
