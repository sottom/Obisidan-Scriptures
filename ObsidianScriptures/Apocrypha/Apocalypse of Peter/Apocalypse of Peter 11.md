###### 1
And there shall be another place, very high. There shall be a furnace and a brazier wherein shall burn fire. The fire that shall burn shall come from one end of the brazier. The men and women whose feet slip, shall go rolling down into a place where is fear. And again while the fire that is prepared floweth, they mount up and fall down again and continue to roll down. Thus shall they be tormented for ever. These are they that honoured not their father and mother and of their own accord withheld themselves from them. Therefore shall they be chastised eternally.

###### 2
Furthermore the angel Ezrael shall bring children and maidens to show them those that are tormented. They shall be chastised with pains, with hanging up and with a multitude of wounds which flesh-devouring birds shall inflict upon them. These are they that trust (boast) in their sins, and obey not their parents and follow not the instruction of their fathers, and honour not them that are more aged than they.

###### 3
Beside them shall be girls clad in darkness for a garment and they shall be sore chastised and their flesh shall be torn in pieces. These are they that kept not their virginity until they were given in marriage, and with these torments shall they be punished, and shall feel them.

###### 4
And again, other men and women, gnawing their tongues without ceasing, and being tormented with everlasting fire. These are the servants which were not obedient unto their masters; and this then is their judgement for ever.
