And the Kerubim are standing by the Holy Chayyoth, and their wings are raised up to their heads (lit. are as the height of their heads) and Shekina is (resting) upon them

and song and praise in their mouth
and their hands are under their wings
and their feet are covered by their wings
and horns of glory are upon their heads
and the splendour of Shekina on their face
and Shekina is (resting) upon them
and sapphire stones are round about them
and columns of fire on their four sides
and columns of firebrands beside them.

And one Kerub is standing in each direction but the wings of the Kerubim compass each other above their skulls in glory; and they spread them to sing with them a song to him that inhabiteth the clouds and to praise with them the fearful majesty of the king of kings.

###### 16
And KERUBIEL H', the prince who is appointed over them, he arrays them in comely, beautiful and pleasant orders and he exalts them in all manner of exaltation, dignity and glory. And he hastens them in glory and might to do the will of their Creator every moment. For above their lofty heads abides continually the glory of the high king "who dwelleth on the Kerubim".
