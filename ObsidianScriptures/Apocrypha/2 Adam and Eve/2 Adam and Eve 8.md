###### 1
When our father Adam saw that his end was near, he called his son Seth, who came to him in the Cave of Treasures,

###### 1
And he said unto him: -

###### 2
"0 Seth, my son bring me thy children and thy children's children, that I may shed my blessing on them ere I die."

###### 3
When Seth heard these words from his father Adam, he went from him, shed a flood of tears over his face, and gathered together his children and his children's children, and brought them to his father Adam.

###### 4
But when our father Adam saw them around him, he wept at having to be separated from them.

###### 5
And when they saw him weeping, they all wept together, and fell upon his face saying, "How shalt thou be severed from us, 0 our father? And how shall the earth receive thee and hide thee from our eyes?" Thus did they lament much, and in like words.

###### 6
Then our father Adam blessed them all, and said to Seth, after he had blessed them:-

###### 7
"0 Seth, my son, thou knowest this world - that it is full of sorrow, and of weariness; and thou knowest all that has come upon us, from our trials in it I therefore flow command thee in these words: to keep innocency, to be pure and just, and trusting in God; and lean not to the discourses of Satan, nor to the apparitions in which he will show himself to thee.

###### 8
But keep the commandments that I give thee this day; then give the same to thy son Enos; and let Enos give it to his son Cainan; and Cainan to his son Mahalaleel; so that this commandment abide firm among all your children.

###### 9
"0 Seth, my son, the moment I am dead take ye my body and wind it up with myrrh, aloes, and cassia, and leave me here in this Cave of Treasures in which are all these tokens which God gave us from the garden.

###### 10
"0 my son, hereafter shall a flood come and overwhelm all creatures, and leave out only eight souls.

###### 11
"But, 0 my son, let those whom it will leave out from among your children at that time, take my body with them out of this cave; and when they have taken it with them, let the oldest among them command his children to lay my body in a ship until the flood has been assuaged, and they come out of the ship.

###### 12
Then they shall take my body and lay it in the middle of the earth, shortly after they have been saved from the waters of the flood.

###### 13
"For the place where my body shall be laid, is the middle of the earth; God shall come from thence and shall save all our kindred.

###### 14
"But now, 0 Seth, my son, place thyself at the head of thy people; tend them and watch over them in the fear of God; and lead them in the good way. Command them to fast unto God; and make them understand they ought not to hearken to Satan, lest he destroy them.

###### 15
"Then, again, sever thy children and thy children's children from Cain's children; do not let them ever mix with those, nor come near them either in their words or in their deeds."

###### 16
Then Adam let his blessing descend upon Seth, and upon his children, and upon all his children's children.

###### 17
He then turned to his son Seth, and to Eve his wife, and ,said to them, "Preserve this gold, this incense, and this myrrh, that God has given us for a sign; for in days that are coming, a flood will overwhelm the whole creation. But those who shall go into the ark shall take with them the gold, the incense, and the myrrh, together with my body; and will lay the gold, the incense, and the myrrh, with my body in the midst of the earth.

###### 18
"Then, after a long time, the city in which the gold, the incense, and the myrrh are found with my body, shall be plundered. But when it is spoiled, the gold the incense, and the myrrh shall be taken care of with the spoil that is kept; and naught of them shall perish, until the Word of God, made man shall come; when kings shall take them, and shall offer to Him, gold in token of His being King; incense, in token of His being God of heaven and earth; and myrrh, in token of His passion.

###### 19
"Gold also, as a token of His overcoming Satan, and all our foes; incense as a token that He will rise from the dead, and be exalted above things in heaven and things in the earth; and myrrh, in token that He will drink bitter gall; and feel the pains of hell from Satan.

###### 20
"And now, 0 Seth, my son, behold I have revealed unto thee hidden mysteries, which God had revealed unto me. Keep my commandment, for thyself, and for thy people."
