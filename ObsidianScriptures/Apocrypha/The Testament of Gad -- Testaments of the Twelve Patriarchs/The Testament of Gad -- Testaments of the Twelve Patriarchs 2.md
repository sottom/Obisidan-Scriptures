###### 1
AND now, my children, I exhort you, love ye each one his brother, and put away hatred from your hearts, love one another in deed, and in word, and in the inclination of the soul.

###### 2
For in the presence of my father I spake peaceably to Joseph; and when I had gone out, the spirit of hatred darkened my mind, and stirred up my soul to slay him.

###### 3
Love ye one another from the heart; and if a man sin against thee, speak peaceably to him, and in thy soul hold not guile; and if he repent and confess, forgive him.

###### 4
But if he deny it, do not get into a passion with him, lest catching the poison from thee he take to swearing and so thou sin doubly.

###### 5
Let not another man hear thy secrets when engaged in legal strife, lest he come to hate thee and become thy enemy, and commit a great sin against thee; for ofttimes he addresseth thee guilefully or busieth himself about thee with wicked intent.

###### 6
And though he deny it and yet have a sense of shame when reproved, give over reproving him.

###### 7
For be who denieth may repent so as not again to wrong thee; yea, he may also honour thee, and fear and be at peace with thee.

###### 8
And if he be shameless and persist in his wrong-doing, even so forgive him from the heart, and leave to God the avenging.

###### 9
If a man prospereth more than you, do not be vexed, but pray also for him, that he may have perfect prosperity.

###### 10
for so it is expedient for you.

###### 11
And if he be further exalted, be not envious of him, remembering that all flesh shall die; and offer praise to God, who giveth things good and profitable to all men.

###### 12
Seek out the judgments of the Lord, and thy mind will rest and be at peace.

###### 13
And though a man become rich by evil means, even as Esau, the brother of my father, be not jealous; but wait for the end of the Lord.

###### 14
For if he taketh away from a man wealth gotten by evil means He forgiveth him if he repent, but the unrepentant is reserved for eternal punishment.

###### 15
For the poor man, if free from envy he pleaseth the Lord in all things, is blessed beyond all men, because he hath not the travail of vain men.

###### 16
Put away, therefore, jealousy from your souls, and love one another with uprightness of heart.

###### 17
Do ye also therefore tell these things to your children, that they honour Judah and Levi, for from them shall the Lord raise up salvation to Israel.

###### 18
For I know that at the last your children shall depart from Him, and shall walk in O wickedness, and affliction and corruption before the Lord.

###### 19
And when he had rested for a little while, he said again; My children, obey your father, and bury me near to my fathers.

###### 20
And he drew up his feet, and fell asleep in peace.

###### 21
And after five years they carried him up to Hebron, and laid him with his fathers.
