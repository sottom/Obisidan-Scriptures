###### 1
The second vision which he saw, the vision of wisdom--which Enoch the son of Jared, the son of Mahalalel, the son of Cainan, the son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, saw. [37:2] And this is the beginning of the words of wisdom which I lifted up my voice to speak and say to those which dwell on earth: Hear, ye men of old time, and see, ye that come after, the words of the Holy One which I will speak before the Lord of Spirits. [37:3] It were better to declare (them only) to the men of old time, but even from those that come after we will not withhold the beginning of wisdom. [37:4] Till the present day such wisdom has never been given by the Lord of Spirits as I have received according to my insight, according to the good pleasure of the Lord of Spirits by whom the lot of eternal life has been given to me. [37:5] Now three parables were imparted to me, and I lifted up my voice and recounted them to those that dwell on the earth.
