###### 1
Oh that mine eyes were [a cloud of] waters That I might weep over you, And pour down my tears as a cloud †of† waters: That so I might rest from my trouble of heart!

###### 2
†Who has permitted you to practice reproaches and wickedness? And so judgement shall overtake you, sinners. †

###### 3
Fear not the sinners, ye righteous; For again will the Lord deliver them into your hands, That ye may execute judgement upon them according to your desires.

###### 4
Woe to you who fulminate anathemas which cannot be reversed: Healing shall therefore be far from you because of your sins.

###### 5
Woe to you who requite your neighbour with evil; For ye shall be requited according to your works.

###### 6
Woe to you, lying witnesses, And to those who weigh out injustice, For suddenly shall ye perish.

###### 7
Woe to you, sinners, for ye persecute the righteous; For ye shall be delivered up and persecuted because of injustice, And heavy shall its yoke be upon you.
