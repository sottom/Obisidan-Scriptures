###### 1
And this is the Second Parable concerning those who deny the name of the dwelling of the holy ones and the Lord of Spirits.

###### 2
And into the heaven they shall not ascend, And on the earth they shall not come: Such shall be the lot of the sinners Who have denied the name of the Lord of Spirits, Who are thus preserved for the day of suffering and tribulation.

###### 3
On that day Mine Elect One shall sit on the throne of glory And shall try their works, And their places of rest shall be innumerable.

###### 4
Then will I cause Mine Elect One to dwell among them.

###### 5
And I will transform the earth and make it a blessing:
And I will cause Mine elect ones to dwell upon it: But the sinners and evil-doers shall not set foot thereon.

###### 6
For I have provided and satisfied with peace My righteous ones And have caused them to dwell before Me:
But for the sinners there is judgement impending with Me, So that I shall destroy them from the face of the earth.
