And they took ⌈and⌉ brought me to a place in which those who were there were like flaming fire, and, when they wished, they appeared as men. [17:2] And they brought me to the place of darkness, and to a mountain the point of whose summit reached to heaven. [17:3] And I saw the places of the luminaries ⌈and the treasuries of the stars⌉ and of the thunder ⌈and⌉ in the uttermost depths, where were a fiery bow and arrows and their quiver, and ⌈⌈a fiery sword⌉⌉ and all the lightnings. [17:4] And they took me to the living waters, and to the fire of the west, which receives every setting of the sun. [17:5] And I came to a river of fire in which the fire flows like water and discharges itself into the great sea towards the west. [17:6] I saw the great rivers and came to the great ⌈river and to the great⌉ darkness, and went to the place where no flesh walks. [17:7] I saw the mountains of the darkness of winter and the place whence all the waters of the deep flow. [17:8] I saw the mouths of all the rivers of the earth and the mouth of the deep.
