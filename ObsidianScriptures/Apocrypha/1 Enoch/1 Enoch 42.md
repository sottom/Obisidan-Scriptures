###### 1
Wisdom found no place where she might dwell; Then a dwelling-place was assigned her in the heavens.

###### 2
Wisdom went forth to make her dwelling among the children of men, And found no dwelling-place:
Wisdom returned to her place, And took her seat among the angels.

###### 3
And unrighteousness went forth from her chambers: Whom she sought not she found, And dwelt with them,
As rain in a desert And dew on a thirsty land.
