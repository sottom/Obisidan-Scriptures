And from thence I went towards the north to the ends of the earth, and there I saw a great and glorious device at the ends of the whole earth. [34:2] And here I saw three portals of heaven open in the heaven: through each of them proceed north winds: when they blow there is cold, hail, frost, snow, dew, and rain. [34:3] And out of one portal they blow for good: but when they blow through the other two portals, it is with violence and affliction on the earth, and they blow with violence.
