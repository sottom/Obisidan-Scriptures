###### 1
Now those who were with Jeremiah were rejoicing and offering sacrifices on behalf of the people for nine days.

###### 2
But on the tenth, Jeremiah alone offered sacrifice.

###### 3
And he prayed a prayer, saying: Holy, holy, holy, fragrant aroma of the living trees, true light that enlightens me until I ascend to you;

###### 4
For your mercy, I beg you -- for the sweet voice of the two seraphim, I beg -- for another fragrant aroma.

###### 5
And may Michael, archangel of righteousness, who opens the gates to the righteous, be my guardian (?) until he causes the righteous to enter.

###### 6
I beg you, almighty Lord of all creation, unbegotten and incomprehensible, in whom all judgment was hidden before these things came into existence.

###### 7
When Jeremiah had said this, and while he was standing in the altar-area with Baruch and Abimelech, he became as one whose soul had departed.

###### 8
And Baruch and Abimelech were weeping and crying out in a loud voice: Woe to us! For our father Jeremiah has left us -- the priest of God has departed!

###### 9
And all the people heard their weeping and they all ran to them and saw Jeremiah lying on the ground as if dead.

###### 10
And they tore their garments and put dust on their heads and wept bitterly.

###### 11
And after this they prepared to bury him.

###### 12
And behold, there came a voice saying: Do not bury the one who yet lives, for his soul is returning to his body!

###### 13
And when they heard the voice they did not bury him, but stayed around his tabernacle for three days saying, "when will he arise?"

###### 14
And after three days his soul came back into his body and he raised his voice in the midst of them all and said: Glorify God with one voice! All of you glorify God and the son of God who awakens us -- messiah Jesus -- the light of all the ages, the inextinguishable lamp, the life of faith.

###### 15
But after these times there shall be 477 years more and he comes to earth.

###### 16
And the tree of life planted in the midst of paradise will cause all the unfruitful trees to bear fruit, and will grow and sprout forth.

###### 17
And the trees that had sprouted and became haughty and said: "We have supplied our power (?) to the air," he will cause them to wither, with the grandeur of their branches, and he will cause them to be judged -- that firmly rooted tree!

###### 18
And what is crimson will become white as wool -- the snow will be blackened -- the sweet waters will become salty, and the salty sweet, in the intense light of the joy of God.

###### 19
And he will bless the isles so that they become fruitful by the word of the mouth of his messiah.

###### 20
For he shall come, and he will go out and choose for himself twelve apostles to proclaim the news among the nations-- he whom I have seen adorned by his father and coming into the world on the Mount of Olives -- and he shall fill the hungry souls.

###### 21
When Jeremiah was saying this concerning the son of God -- that he is coming into the world -- the people became very angry and said: This is a repetition of the words spoken by Isaiah son of Amos, when he said: I saw God and the son of God.

###### 22
Come, then, and let us not kill him by the same sort of death with which we killed Isaiah, but let us stone him with stones.

###### 23
And Baruch and Abimelech were greatly grieved because they wanted to hear in full the mysteries that he had seen.

###### 24
But Jeremiah said to them: Be silent and weep not, for they cannot kill me until I describe for you everything I saw.

###### 25
And he said to them: Bring a stone here to me.

###### 26
And he set it up and said: Light of the ages, make this stone to become like me in appearance, until I have described to Baruch and Abimelech everything I saw.

###### 27
Then the stone, by God's command, took on the appearance of Jeremiah.

###### 28
And they were stoning the stone, supposing that it was Jeremiah!

###### 29
But Jeremiah delivered to Baruch and to Abimelech all the mysteries he had seen, and forthwith he stood in the midst of the people desiring to complete his ministry.

###### 30
Then the stone cried out, saying: O foolish children of Israel, why do you stone me, supposing that I am Jeremiah? Behold, Jeremiah is standing in your midst!

###### 31
And when they saw him, immediately they rushed upon him with many stones, and his ministry was fulfilled.

###### 32
And when Baruch and Abimelech came, they buried him, and taking the stone they placed it on his tomb and inscribed it thus: This is the stone that was the ally of Jeremiah.
