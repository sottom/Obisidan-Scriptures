###### 1
After this, Abimelech went out of the city and prayed to the Lord.

###### 2
And behold, an angel of the Lord came and took him by the right hand and brought him back to where Baruch was sitting, and he found him in a tomb.

###### 3
And when they saw each other, they both wept and kissed each other.

###### 4
But when Baruch looked up he saw with his own eyes the figs that were covered in Abimelech's basket.

###### 5
And lifting his eyes to heaven, he prayed, saying:

###### 6
You are the God who gives a reward to those who love you. Prepare yourself, my heart, and rejoice and be glad while you are in your tabernacle, saying to your fleshly house, "your grief has been changed to joy;" for the Sufficient One is coming and will deliver you in your tabernacle -- for there is no sin in you.

###### 7
Revive in your tabernacle, in your virginal faith, and believe that you will live!

###### 8
Look at this basket of figs -- for behold, they are 66 years old and have not become shrivelled or rotten, but they are dripping milk.

###### 9
So it will be with you, my flesh, if you do what is commanded you by the angel of righteousness.

###### 10
He who preserved the basket of figs, the same will again preserve you by his power.

###### 11
When Baruch had said this, he said to Abimelech: Stand up and let us pray that the Lord may make known to us how we shall be able to send to Jeremiah in Babylon the report about the shelter provided for you on the way.

###### 12
And Baruch prayed, saying: Lord God, our strength is the elect light which comes forth from your mouth.

###### 13
We beseech and beg of your goodness -- you whose great name no one is able to know -- hear the voice of your servants and let knowledge come into our hearts.

###### 14
What shall we do, and how shall we send this report to Jeremiah in Babylon?

###### 15
And while Baruch was still praying, behold an angel of the Lord came and said all these words to Baruch: Agent of the light, do not be anxious about how you will send to Jeremiah; for an eagle is coming to you at the hour of light tomorrow, and you will direct him to Jeremiah.

###### 16
Therefore, write in a letter: Say to the children of Israel: Let the stranger who comes among you be set apart and let 15 days go by; and after this I will lead you into your city, says the Lord.

###### 17
He who is not separated from Babylon will not enter into the city; and I will punish them by keeping them from being received back by the Babylonians, says the Lord.

###### 18
And when the angel had said this, he departed from Baruch.

###### 19
And Baruch sent to the market of the gentiles and got papyrus and ink and wrote a letter as follows: Baruch, the servant of God, writes to Jeremiah in the captivity of Babylon:

###### 20
Greetings! Rejoice, for God has not allowed us to depart from this body grieving for the city which was laid waste and outraged.

###### 21
Wherefore the Lord has had compassion on our tears, and has remembered the covenant which he established with our fathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.

###### 22
And he sent his angel to me, and he told me these words which I send to you.

###### 13
These, then, are the words which the Lord, the God of Israel, spoke, who led us out of Egypt, out of the great furnace: Because you did not keep my ordinances, but your heart was lifted up, and you were haughty before me, in anger and wrath I delivered you to the furnace in Babylon.

###### 24
If, therefore, says the Lord, you listen to my voice, from the mouth of Jeremiah my servant, I will bring the one who listens up from Babylon; but the one who does not listen will become a stranger to Jerusalem and to Babylon.

###### 25
And you will test them by means of the water of the Jordan; whoever does not listen will be exposed -- this is the sign of the great seal.
