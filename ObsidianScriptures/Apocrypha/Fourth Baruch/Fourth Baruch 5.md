###### 1
But Abimelech took the figs in the burning heat; and coming upon a tree, he sat under its shade to rest a bit.

###### 2
And leaning his head on the basket of figs, he fell asleep and slept for 66 years; and he was not awakened from his slumber.

###### 3
And afterward, when he awoke from his sleep, he said: I slept sweetly for a little while, but my head is heavy because I did not get enough sleep.

###### 4
Then he uncovered the basket of figs and found them dripping milk.

###### 5
And he said: I would like to sleep a little longer, because my head is heavy. But I am afraid that I might fall asleep and be late in awakening and my father Jeremiah would think badly of me; for if he were not in a hurry, he would not have sent me today at daybreak.

###### 6
So I will get up, and proceed in the burning heat; for isn't there heat, isn't there toil every day?

###### 7
So he got up and took the basket of figs and placed it on his shoulders, and he entered into Jerusalem and did not recognize it -- neither his own house, nor the place -- nor did he find his own family or any of his acquaintances.

###### 8
And he said: The Lord be blessed, for a great trance has come over me today!

###### 9
This is not the city Jerusalem -- and I have lost my way because I came by the mountain road when I arose from my sleep; and since my head was heavy because I did not get enough sleep, I lost my way.

###### 10
It will seem incredible to Jeremiah that I lost my way!

###### 11
And he departed from the city; and as he searched he saw the landmarks of the city, and he said: Indeed, this is the city; I lost my way.

###### 12
And again he returned to the city and searched, and found no one of his own people; and he said: The Lord be blessed, for a great trance has come over me!

###### 13
And again he departed from the city, and he stayed there grieving, not knowing where he should go.

###### 14
And he put down the basket, saying: I will sit here until the Lord takes this trance from me.

###### 15
And as he sat, he saw an old man coming from the field; and Abimelech said to him: I say to you, old man, what city is this?

###### 16
And he said to him: It is Jerusalem.

###### 17
And Abimelech said to him: Where is Jeremiah the priest, and Baruch the secretary, and all the people of this city, for I could not find them?

###### 18
And the old man said to him: Are you not from this city, seeing that you remember Jeremiah today, because you are asking about him after such a long time?

###### 19
For Jeremiah is in Babylon with the people; for they were taken captive by king Nebuchadnezzar, and Jeremiah is with them to preach the good news to them and to teach them the word.

###### 20
As soon as Abimelech heard this from the old man, he said: If you were not an old man, and if it were not for the fact that it is not lawful for a man to upbraid one older than himself, I would laugh at you and say that you are out of your mind -- since you say that the people have been taken captive into Babylon.

###### 21
Even if the heavenly torrents had descended on them, there has not yet been time for them to go into Babylon!

###### 22
For how much time has passed since my father Jeremiah sent me to the estate of Agrippa to bring a few figs, so that I might give them to the sick among the people?

###### 23
And I went and got them, and when I came to a certain tree in the burning heat, I sat to rest a little; and I leaned my head on the basket and fell asleep.

###### 24
And when I awoke I uncovered the basket of figs, supposing that I was late; and I found the figs dripping milk, just as I had collected them.

###### 25
But you claim that the people have been taken captive into Babylon.

###### 26
But that you might know, take the figs and see!

###### 27
And he uncovered the basket of figs for the old man, and he saw them dripping milk.

###### 28
And when the old man saw them, he said: O my son, you are a righteous man, and God did not want you to see the desolation of the city, so he brought this trance upon you.

###### 29
For behold it is 66 years today since the people were taken captive into Babylon.

###### 30
But that you might learn, my son, that what I tell you is true -- look into the field and see that the ripening of the crops has not appeared.

###### 31
And notice that the figs are not in season, and be enlightened.

###### 32
Then Abimelech cried out in a loud voice, saying: I bless you, God of heaven and earth, the Rest of the souls of the righteous in every place!

###### 33
Then he said to the old man: What month is this?

###### 34
And he said: Nisan (which is Abib).

###### 35
And taking some of figs, he gave them to the old man and said to him: May God illumine your way to the city above, Jerusalem. 6
