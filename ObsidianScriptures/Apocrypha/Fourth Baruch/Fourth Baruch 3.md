###### 1
And when the hour of the night arrived, as the Lord had told Jeremiah they came up together on the walls of the city, Jeremiah and Baruch.

###### 2
And behold, there came a sound of trumpets; and angels emerged from heaven holding torches in their hands, and they set them on the walls of the city.

###### 3
And when Jeremiah and Baruch saw them, they wept, saying: Now we know that the word is true!

###### 4
And Jeremiah besought the angels, saying: I beseech you, do not destroy the city yet, until I say something to the Lord.

###### 5
And the Lord spoke to the angels, saying: Do not destroy the city until I speak to my chosen one, Jeremiah.

###### 6
Then Jeremiah spoke, saying: I beg you, Lord, bid me to speak in your presence.

###### 7
And the Lord said: Speak, my chosen one Jeremiah.

###### 8
And Jeremiah said: Behold, Lord, now we know that you are delivering the city into the hands of its enemies, and they will take the people away to Babylon. What do you want me to do with the holy vessels of the temple service?

###### 10
And the Lord said to him: Take them and consign them to the earth, saying: Hear, Earth, the voice of your creator who formed you in the abundance of waters, who sealed you with seven seals for seven epochs, and after this you will receive your ornaments (?) --

###### 11
Guard the vessels of the temple service until the gathering of the beloved.

###### 12
And Jeremiah spoke, saying: I beseech you, Lord, show me what I should do for Abimelech the Ethiopian, for he has done many kindnesses to your servant Jeremiah.

###### 13
For he pulled me out of the miry pit; and I do not wish that he should see the destruction and desolation of this city, but that you should be merciful to him and that he should not be grieved.

###### 14
And the Lord said to Jeremiah: Send him to the vineyard of Agrippa, and I will hide him in the shadow of the mountain until I cause the people to return to the city.

###### 15
And you, Jeremiah, go with your people into Babylon and stay with them, preaching to them, until I cause them to return to the city.

###### 16
But leave Baruch here until I speak with him.

###### 17
When he had said these things, the Lord ascended from Jeremiah into heaven.

###### 18
But Jeremiah and Baruch entered the holy place, and taking the vessels of the temple service, they consigned them to the earth as the Lord had told them.

###### 19
And immediately the earth swallowed them.

###### 20
And they both sat down and wept.

###### 21
And when morning came, Jeremiah sent Abimelech, saying: Take a basket and go to the estate of Agrippa by the mountain road, and bring back some figs to give to the sick among the people; for the favor of the Lord is on you and his glory is on your head.

###### 22
And when he had said this, Jeremiah sent him away; and Abimelech went as he told him.
