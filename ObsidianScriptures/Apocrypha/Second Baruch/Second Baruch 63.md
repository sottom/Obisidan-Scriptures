###### 1
'And the bright eighth waters which thou hast seen, this is the rectitude and uprightness of Hezekiah king of Judah and the grace (of God) which came upon him.

###### 2
For when Sennacherib was stirred up in order that he might perish, and his wrath troubled him in order that he might thereby perish, for the multitude also of the nations which were with him.

###### 3
When, moreover, Hezekiah the king heard those things which the king of Assyria was devising, (i.e.) to come and seize him and destroy his people, the two and a half tribes which remained: nay, more he wished to overthrow Zion also: then Hezekiah trusted in his works, and had hope in his righteousness, and spake with the Mighty One and said:

###### 4
"Behold, for lo! Sennacherib is prepared to destroy us, and he will be boastful and uplifted when he has destroyed Zion."

###### 5
And the Mighty One heard him, for Hezekiah was wise, And He had respect unto his prayer, because he was righteous.

###### 6
And thereupon the Mighty One commanded Ramiel His angel who speaks with thee.

###### 7
And I went forth and destroyed their multitude, the number of whose chiefs only was a hundred and eighty-five thousand, and each one of them had an equal number (at his command).

###### 8
And at that time I burned their bodies within, but their raiment and arms I preserved outwardly, in order that the still more wonderful deeds of the Mighty One might appear, and that thereby His name might be spoken of throughout the whole earth.

###### 9
And Zion was saved and Jerusalem delivered: Israel also was freed from tribulation.

###### 10
And all those who were in the holy land rejoiced, and the name of the Mighty One was glorified so that it was spoken of.

###### 11
These are the bright waters which thou hast seen.
