###### 1
'But, do thou, Baruch, direct thy heart to that which has been said to thee, And understand those things which have been shown to thee; For there are many eternal consolations for thee.

###### 2
For thou shalt depart from this place, And thou shalt pass from the regions which are now seen by thee, And thou shalt forget whatever is corruptible, And shalt not again recall those things which happen among mortals.

###### 3
Go therefore and command thy people, and come to this place, and afterwards fast seven days, and then I will come to thee and speak with thee.'
