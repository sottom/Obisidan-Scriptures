###### 2
And all the iniquities which kings who were after him iniquitously wrought.

###### 3
And the curse of Jezebel and the worship of idols which Israel practised at that time.

###### 4
And the withholding of rain, and the famines which occurred until women eat the fruit of their wombs.

###### 5
And the time of their captivity which came upon the nine tribes and a half, because they were in many sins.

###### 6
And Salmanasar king of Assyria came and led them away captive.
