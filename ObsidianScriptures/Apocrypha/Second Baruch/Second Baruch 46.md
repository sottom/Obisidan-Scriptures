###### 1
And my son and the elders of the people answered and said unto me: 'Has the Mighty One humiliated us to such a degree As to take thee from us quickly?

###### 2
And truly we shall be in darkness, And there shall be no light to the people who are left For where again shall we seek the law,

###### 3
Or who will distinguish for us between death and life?'

###### 4
And I said unto them: 'The throne of the Mighty One I cannot resist; Nevertheless, there shall not be wanting to Israel a wise man Nor a son of the law to the race of Jacob.

###### 5
But only prepare ye your hearts, that ye may obey the law, And be subject to those who in fear are wise and understanding; And prepare your souls that ye may not depart from them.

###### 6
For if ye do these things, Good tidings shall come unto you. [Which I before told you of; nor shall ye fall into the torment, of which I testified to you before.'

###### 7
But with regard to the word that I was to be taken I did not make (it) known to them or to my son.]
