And I said:

###### 2
'O Lord, my Lord, have I come into the world for this purpose that I might see the evils of my mother?

###### 3
Not (so) my Lord. If I have found grace in Thy sight, first take my spirit that I may go to my fathers and not behold the destruction of my mother.

###### 4
For two things vehemently constrain me: for I cannot resist Thee, and my soul, moreover, cannot behold the evils of my mother. But one thing I will say in Thy presence, O Lord. What, therefore, will there be after these things?

###### 5
for if Thou destroyest Thy city, and deliverest up Thy land to those that hate us, how shall the name of Israel be again remembered?

###### 6
Or how shall one speak of Thy praises? or to whom shall that which is in Thy law be explained?

###### 7
Or shall the world return to its nature (of), aforetime and the age revert to primeval silence?

###### 8
And shall the multitude of souls be taken away, and the nature of man not again be named?

###### 9
And where is all that which Thou didst say to Moses regarding us?'
