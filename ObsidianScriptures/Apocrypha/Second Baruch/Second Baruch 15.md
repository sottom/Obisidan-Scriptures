###### 1
And the Lord answered and said unto me: 'Thou art rightly astonied regarding the departure of man, but thou hast not judged well regarding the evils which befall those who sin.

###### 2
And as regards what thou hast said, that the righteous are carried off and the impious are prospered,

###### 3
And as regards what thou hast said "Man knows not Thy judgement"

###### 4
-- On this account hear, and I will speak to thee, and hearken, and I will cause thee to hear My words.

###### 5
Man would not rightly have understood My judgement, unless he had accepted the law, and I had instructed him in understanding.

###### 6
But now, because he transgressed wittingly, yea, just on this ground that he wot (thereof), he shall be tormented.

###### 7
And as regards what thou didst say touching the righteous, that on account of them has this world come, so also again shall that, which is to come, come on their account.

###### 8
For this world is to them a strife and a labour with much trouble; and that accordingly which is to come, a crown with great glory.'
