###### 1
And it came to pass after these things that lo! the heavens were opened, and I saw, and power was given to me, and a voice was heard from on high, and it said unto me:

###### 2
'Baruch, Baruch, why art thou troubled?

###### 3
He who travels by a road but does not complete it, or who departs by sea but does not arrive at the port, can he be comforted?

###### 4
Or he who promises to give a present to another, but does not fulfill it, is it not robbery?

###### 5
Or he who sows the earth, but does not reap its fruit in its season, does he not lose everything?

###### 6
Or he who plants a plant unless it grows till the time suitable to it, does he who planted it expect to receive fruit from it?

###### 7
Or a woman who has conceived, if she bring forth untimely, does she not assuredly slay her infant?

###### 8
Or he who builds a house, if he does not roof it and complete it, can it be called a house? Tell Me that first.'
