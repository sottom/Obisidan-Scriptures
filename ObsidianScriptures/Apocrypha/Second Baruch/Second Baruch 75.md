###### 1
And I answered and said: Who can understand, O Lord, Thy goodness? For it is incomprehensible.

###### 2
Or who can search into thy compassions, Which are infinite?

###### 3
Or who can comprehend Thy intelligence?

###### 4
Or who is able to recount the thoughts of Thy mind?

###### 5
Or who of those who are born can hope to come to those things, Unless he is one to whom Thou art merciful and gracious?

###### 6
Because, if assuredly Thou didst not have compassion on man, Those who are under Thy right hand, They could not come to those things, But those who are in the numbers named can be called.

###### 7
But if, indeed, we who exist know wherefore we have come, And submit ourselves to Him who brought us out of Egypt, We shall come again and remember those things which have passed, And shall rejoice regarding that which has been.

###### 8
But if now we know not wherefore we have come, And recognize not the principate of Him who brought us up out of Egypt, We shall come again and seek after those things which have been now, And be grieved with pain because of those things which have befallen.'
