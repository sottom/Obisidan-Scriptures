###### 1
Now, my brethren, learn first what befell Zion: how that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against us.

###### 2
For we have sinned against Him who made us, and we have not kept the commandments which he commanded us,

###### 3
yet he hath not chastened us as we deserved.

###### 4
For what befell you we also suffer in a pre-eminent degree, for it befell us also.
