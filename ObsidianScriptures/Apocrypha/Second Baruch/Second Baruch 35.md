###### 1
And I, Baruch, went to the holy place, and sat down upon the ruins and wept, and said:

###### 2
'O that mine eyes were springs, And mine eyelids a fount of tears.

###### 3
For how shall I lament for Zion, And how shall I mourn for Jerusalem?

###### 4
Because in that place where I am now prostrate, Of old the high priest offered holy sacrifices, And placed thereon an incense of fragrant odours.

###### 5
But now our glorying has been made into dust, And the desire of our soul into sand.'
