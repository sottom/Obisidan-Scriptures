###### 1
And I besought the Mighty One, and said: Thou alone, O Lord, knowest of aforetime the deep things of the world, And the things which befall in their times Thou bringest about by Thy word, And against the works of the inhabitants of the earth Thou dost hasten the beginnings of the times, And the end of the seasons Thou alone knowest.

###### 2
(Thou) for whom nothing is too hard, But who dost everything easily by a nod:

###### 3
(Thou) to whom the depths come as the heights, And whose word the beginnings of the ages serve:

###### 4
(Thou) who revealest to those who fear Thee what is prepared for them, That thenceforth they may be comforted.

###### 5
Thou showest great acts to those who know not; Thou breakest up the enclosure of those who are ignorant, And lightest up what is dark, And revealest what is hidden to the pure, [Who in faith have submitted themselves to Thee and Thy law.]

###### 6
Thou hast shown to Thy servant this vision; Reveal to me also its interpretation.

###### 7
For I know that as regards those things wherein I besought Thee, I have received a response, And as regards what I besought, Thou didst reveal to me with what voice I should praise Thee, And from what members I should cause praises and hallelujahs to ascend to Thee.

###### 8
For if my members were mouths, And the hairs of my head voices, Even so I could not give Thee the meed of praise, Nor laud thee as is befitting, Nor could I recount Thy praise, Nor tell the glory of Thy beauty.

###### 9
For what am I amongst men, Or why am I reckoned amongst those who are more excellent than I, That I have heard all these marvelous things from the Most High, And numberless promises from Him who created me?

###### 10
Blessed be my mother among those that bear, And praised among women be she that bare me.

###### 11
For I will not be silent in praising the Mighty One, And with the voice of praise I will recount His marvellous deeds.

###### 12
For who doeth like unto Thy marvellous deeds, O God, Or who comprehendeth Thy deep thought of life.

###### 13
For with Thy counsel Thou dost govern all the creatures which Thy right hand has created, And Thou hast established every fountain of light beside Thee, And the treasures of wisdom beneath Thy throne hast Thou prepared.

###### 14
And justly do they perish who have not loved Thy law, And the torment of judgement shall await those who have not submitted themselves to Thy power.

###### 15
For though Adam first sinned And brought untimely death upon all, Yet of those who were born from him Each one of them has prepared for his own soul torment to come, And again each one of them has chosen for himself glories to come.

###### 16
[For assuredly he who believeth will receive reward.

###### 17
But now, as for you, ye wicked that now are, turn ye to destruction, because ye shall speedily be visited, in that formerly ye rejected the understanding of the Most High.

###### 18
For His works have not taught you, Nor has the skill of His creation which is at all times persuaded you.]

###### 19
Adam is therefore not the cause, save only of his own soul, But each of us has been the Adam of his own soul.

###### 20
But do Thou, O Lord, expound to me regarding those things which Thou hast revealed to me, And inform me regarding that which I besought Thee.

###### 21
For at the consummation of the world vengeance shall be taken upon those who have done wickedness according to their wickedness, And Thou wilt glorify the faithful according to their faithfulness.

###### 22
For those who are amongst Thine own Thou rulest, And those who sin Thou blottest out from amongst Thine own.'
