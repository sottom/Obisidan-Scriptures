###### 1
'Hear now also regarding the bright lightning which is to come at the consummation after these black (waters): this is the word.

###### 2
After the signs have come, of which thou wast told before, when the nations become turbulent, and the time of My Messiah is come, he shall both summon all the nations, and some of them he shall spare, and some of them he shall slay.

###### 3
These things therefore shall come upon the nations which are to be spared by Him.

###### 4
Every nation, which knows not Israel and has not trodden down the seed of Jacob, shall indeed be spared.

###### 5
And this because some out of every nation shall be subjected to thy people.

###### 6
But all those who have ruled over you, or have known you, shall be given up to the sword.
