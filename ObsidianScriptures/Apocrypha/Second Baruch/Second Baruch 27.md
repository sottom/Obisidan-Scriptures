###### 1
And He answered and said unto me: 'Into twelve parts is that time divided, and each one of them is reserved for that which is appointed for it.

###### 2
In the first part there shall be the beginning of commotions.

###### 3
And in the second part (there shall be) slayings of the great ones.

###### 4
And in the third part the fall of many by death.

###### 5
And in the fourth part the sending of the sword.

###### 6
And in the fifth part famine and the withholding of rain.

###### 7
And in the sixth part earthquakes and terrors.

###### 8
And in the eighth part a multitude of spectres and attacks of the Shedim.

###### 9
And in the ninth part the fall of fire.

###### 10
And in the tenth part rapine and much oppression,

###### 11
And in the eleventh part wickedness and unchastity.

###### 12
And in the twelfth part confusion from the mingling together of all those things aforesaid.

###### 13
For these parts of that time are reserved, and shall be mingled one with another and minister one to another.

###### 14
For some shall leave out some of their own, and receive (in its stead) from others, and some complete their own and that of others, so that those may not understand who are upon the earth in those days that this is the consummation of the times.
