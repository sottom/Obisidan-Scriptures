It is proposed that we sustain Brother Angel Abrea as a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy.

All in favor, please manifest it. Any opposed, so manifest it.

With the exception of Elder Abrea, whom we have just sustained, there have been no other changes since the last general conference. It is proposed, therefore, that we sustain all of the General Authorities and general officers of the Church as at present constituted.

All in favor, please manifest it. Contrary, if there by any, by the same sign.
