###### 1
It came to pass, when the children of Israel were taken captive by the king of the Chaldeans, that God spoke to Jeremiah saying: Jeremiah, my chosen one, arise and depart from this city, you and Baruch, since I am going to destroy it because of the multitude of the sins of those who dwell in it.

###### 2
For your prayers are like a solid pillar in its midst, and like an indestructible wall surrounding it.

###### 3
Now, then, arise and depart before the host of the Chaldeans surrounds it.

###### 4
And Jeremiah answered, saying: I beseech you, Lord, permit me, your servant, to speak in your presence.

###### 5
And the Lord said to him: Speak, my chosen one Jeremiah.

###### 6
And Jeremiah spoke, saying: Lord Almighty, would you deliver the chosen city into the hands of the Chaldeans, so that the king with the multitude of his people might boast and say: "I have prevailed over the holy city of God"?

###### 7
No, my Lord, but if it is your will, let it be destroyed by your hands.

###### 8
And the Lord said to Jeremiah: Since you are my chosen one, arise and depart form this city, you and Baruch, for I am going to destroy it because of the multitude of the sins of those who dwell in it.

###### 9
For neither the king nor his host will be able to enter it unless I first open its gates.

###### 10
Arise, then, and go to Baruch, and tell him these words.

###### 11
And when you have arisen at the sixth hour of the night, go out on the city walls and I will show you that unless I first destroy the city, they cannot enter it.

###### 12
When the Lord had said this, he departed from Jeremiah.
