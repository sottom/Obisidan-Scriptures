###### 1
He said unto me, Be innocent and without disguise; so shalt thou be like an infant who knows no malice which destroys the life of man.

###### 2
Especially see that thou speak evil of none, nor willingly hear any one speak evil of others.

###### 3
For if thou observest not this, thou also who hearest shall be partaker of the sin of him that speaketh evil, by believing the slander, and thou also shalt have sin, because thou believest him that spoke evil of thy brother.

###### 4
Detraction is a pernicious thing; an inconstant, evil spirit; that never continues in peace, but is always in discord. Wherefore refrain thyself from it, and keep peace ever more with thy brother.

###### 5
Put on an holy constancy, in which there are no sins, but all is full of joy; and do good of thy labours.

###### 6
Give without distinction to all that are in want, not doubting to whom thou givest.

###### 7
But give to all, for God will have us give to all, of all his own gifts. They therefore that receive shall give an account to God, both wherefore they received and for what end.

###### 8
And they that receive without real need, shall give an account for it; but he that gives shall be innocent.

###### 9
For he has fulfilled his duty as he received it from God; not making any choice to whom he should give, and to whom not. And this service he did with simplicity and to the glory of God.

###### 10
Keep therefore this command according as I have delivered it into thee: that thy repentance nay be found to be sincere, and that good may come to thy house; and have a pure heart.
