###### 1
But when the merciful God saw that Satan wished to kill Adam with his
many tricks, and saw that Adam was meek and without guile, God spoke to
Satan in a loud voice, and cursed him.

###### 2
Then he and his hosts fled, and Adam and Eve remained standing on the
top of the mountain, from there they saw below them the wide world,
high above which they were.  But they saw none of the host which time
after time were by them.

###### 3
They cried, both Adam and Eve, before God, and begged for forgiveness
of Him.

###### 4
Then came the Word from God to Adam, and said to him, "Know you and
understand concerning this Satan, that he seeks to deceive you and your
descendants after you."

###### 5
And Adam cried before the Lord God, and begged and prayed to Him to
give him something from the garden, as a token to him, wherein to be
comforted.

###### 6
And God considered Adam's thought, and sent the angel Michael as far
as the sea that reaches India, to take from there golden rods and bring
them to Adam.

###### 7
This did God in His wisdom in order that these golden rods, being
with Adam in the cave, should shine forth with light in the night
around him, and put an end to his fear of the darkness.

###### 8
Then the angel Michael went down by God's order, took golden rods, as
God had commanded him, and brought them to God.
