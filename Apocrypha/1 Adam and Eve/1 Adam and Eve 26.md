###### 1
Then Adam took Eve, and they began to return to the Cave of Treasures
where they lived.  But when they got closer to it and saw it from a
distance, heavy sorrow fell on Adam and Eve when they looked at it.

###### 2
Then Adam said to Eve, "When we were on the mountain we were
comforted by the Word of God that conversed with us; and the light that
came from the east shown over us.

###### 3
But now the Word of God is hidden from us; and the light that shown
over us is so changed as to disappear, and let darkness and sorrow come
over us.

###### 4
And we are forced to enter this cave which is like a prison, in which
darkness covers us, so that we are separated from each other; and you
can not see me, neither can I see you."

###### 5
When Adam had said these words, they cried and spread their hands
before God; for they were full of sorrow.

###### 6
And they prayed to God to bring the sun to them, to shine on them, so
that darkness would not return to them, and that they wouldn't have to
go under this covering of rock.  And they wished to die rather than see
the darkness.

###### 7
Then God looked at Adam and Eve and at their great sorrow, and at all
they had done with a fervent heart, on account of all the trouble they
were in, instead of their former well-being, and on account of all the
misery that came over them in a strange land.

###### 8
Therefore God was not angry with them; nor impatient with them; but
he was patient and forbearing towards them, as towards the children He
had created.

###### 9
Then came the Word of God to Adam, and said to him, "Adam, as for the
sun, if I were to take it and bring it to you, days, hours, years and
months would all stop, and the covenant I have made with you, would
never be fulfilled.

###### 10
But then you would be deserted and stuck in a perpetual plague, and
you would never be saved.

###### 11
Yes, rather, bear long and calm your soul while you live night and
day; until the fulfillment of the days, and the time of My covenant is
come.

###### 12
Then shall I come and save you, O Adam, for I do not wish that you
be afflicted.

###### 13
And when I look at all the good things in which you lived, and why
you came out of them, then would I willingly show you mercy.

###### 14
But I cannot alter the covenant that has gone out of My mouth;
otherwise I would have brought you back into the garden.

###### 15
When, however, the covenant is fulfilled, then shall I show you and
your descendants mercy, and bring you into a land of gladness, where
there is neither sorrow nor suffering; but abiding joy and gladness,
and light that never fails, and praises that never cease; and a
beautiful garden that shall never pass away."

###### 16
And God said again to Adam, "Be patient and enter the cave, for the
darkness, of which you were afraid, shall only be twelve hours long;
and when ended, light shall come up."

###### 17
Then when Adam heard these words from God, he and Eve worshipped
before Him, and their hearts were comforted.  They returned into the
cave after their custom, while tears flowed from their eyes, sorrow and
wailing came from their hearts, and they wished their soul would leave
their body.

###### 18
And Adam and Eve stood praying until the darkness of night came over
them, and Adam was hid from Eve, and she from him.

###### 19
And they remained standing in prayer.
