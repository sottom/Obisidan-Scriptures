###### 1
But Adam and Eve cried for having come out of the garden, their first
home.

###### 2
And indeed, when Adam looked at his flesh, that was altered, he cried
bitterly, he and Eve, over what they had done.  And they walked and
went gently down into the Cave of Treasures.

###### 3
And as they came to it, Adam cried over himself and said to Eve,
"Look at this cave  that is to  be our prison in this world, and a
place of punishment!

###### 4
What is it compared with the garden?  What is its narrowness compared
with the space of the other?

###### 5
What is this rock, by the side of those groves?  What is the gloom of
this cavern, compared with the light of the garden?

###### 6
What is this overhanging ledge of rock to shelter us, compared with
the mercy of the Lord that overshadowed us?

###### 7
What is the soil of this cave compared with the garden land?  This
earth, strewed with stones; and that, planted with delicious fruit
trees?"

###### 8
And Adam said to Eve, "Look at your eyes, and at mine, which before
beheld angels praising in heaven; and they too, without ceasing.

###### 9
But now we do not see as we did; our eyes have become of flesh; they
cannot see like they used to see before."

###### 10
Adam said again to Eve, "What is our body today, compared to what it
was in former days, when we lived in the garden?"

###### 11
After this, Adam did not want to enter the cave, under the
overhanging rock; nor would he ever want to enter it.

###### 12
But he bowed to God's orders; and said to himself, "Unless I enter
the cave, I shall again be a transgressor."
