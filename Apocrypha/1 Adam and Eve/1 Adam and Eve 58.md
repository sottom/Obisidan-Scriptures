###### 1
Then Adam and Eve spread their hands before God, praying and begging
Him to drive Satan away from them so that he can't harm them or force
them to deny God.

###### 2
Then God sent to them at once, His angel, who drove away Satan from
them.  This happened about sunset, on the fifty-third day after they
had come out of the garden.

###### 3
Then Adam and Eve went into the cave, and stood up and turned their
faces to the ground, to pray to God.

###### 4
But before they prayed Adam said to Eve, "Look, you have seen what
temptations have befallen us in this land.  Come, let us get up, and
ask God to forgive us the sins we have committed; and we will not come
out until the end of the day next to the fortieth.  And if we die in
here, He will save us."

###### 5
Then Adam and Eve got up, and joined together in entreating God.

###### 6
They continued praying like this in the cave; neither did they come
out of it, by night or by day, until their prayers went up out of their
mouths, like a flame of fire.
