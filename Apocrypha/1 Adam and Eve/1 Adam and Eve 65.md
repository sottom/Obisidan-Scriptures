###### 1
And when it was day, they got up and prayed, after their custom, and
then went out of the cave.

###### 2
But they became sick from the food they had eaten because they were
not used to it, so they went about in the cave saying to each other:--

###### 3
"What has our eating caused to happen to us, that we should be in
such pain?  We are in misery, we shall die!  It would have been better
for us to have died keeping our bodies pure than to have eaten and
defiled them with food."

###### 4
Then Adam said to Eve, "This pain did not come to us in the garden,
neither did we eat such bad food there.  Do you think, O Eve, that God
will plague us through the food that is in us, or that our innards will
come out; or that God means to kill us with this pain before He has
fulfilled His promise to us?"

###### 5
Then Adam besought the Lord and said, "O Lord, let us not perish
through the food we have eaten.  O Lord, don't punish us; but deal with
us according to Your great mercy, and forsake us not until the day of
the promise You have made us."

###### 6
Then God looked at them, and then fitted them for eating food at
once; as to this day; so that they should not perish.

###### 7
Then Adam and Eve came back into the cave sorrowful and crying
because of the alteration of their bodies.  And they both knew from
that hour that they were altered beings, that all hope of returning to
the garden was now lost; and that they could not enter it.

###### 8
For that now their bodies had strange functions; and all flesh that
requires food and drink for its existence, cannot be in the garden.

###### 9
Then Adam said to Eve, "Behold, our hope is now lost; and so is our
trust to enter the garden.  We no longer belong to the inhabitants of
the garden; but from now on we are earthy and of the dust, and of the
inhabitants of the earth.  We shall not return to the garden, until the
day in which God has promised to save us, and to bring us again into
the garden, as He promised us."

###### 10
Then they prayed to God that He would have mercy on them; after
which, their mind was quieted, their hearts were broken, and their
longing was cooled down; and they were like strangers on earth.  That
night Adam and Eve spent in the cave, where they slept heavily by
reason of the food they had eaten.
