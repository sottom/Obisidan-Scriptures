###### 1
Then when God, who is merciful and full of pity, heard Adam's voice,
He said to him:--

###### 2
"O Adam, so long as the good angel was obedient to Me, a bright light
rested on him and on his hosts.

###### 3
But when he transgressed My commandment, I deprived him of that
bright nature, and he became dark.

###### 4
And when he was in the heavens, in the realms of light, he knew
nothing of darkness.

###### 5
But he transgressed, and I made him fall from the heaven onto the
earth; and it was this darkness that came over him.

###### 6
And on you, O Adam, while in My garden and obedient to Me, did that
bright light rest also.

###### 7
But when I heard of your transgression, I deprived you of that bright
light.  Yet, of My mercy, I did not turn you into darkness, but I made
you your body of flesh, over which I spread this skin, in order that it
may bear cold and heat.

###### 8
If I had let My wrath fall heavily on you, I should have destroyed
you; and had I turned you into darkness, it would have been as if I had
killed you.

###### 9
But in My mercy, I have made you as you are; when you transgressed My
commandment, O Adam, I drove you from the garden, and made you come
forth into this land; and commanded you to live in this cave; and
darkness covered you, as it did over him who transgressed My
commandment.

###### 10
Thus, O Adam, has this night deceived you.  It is not to last
forever; but is only of twelve hours; when it is over, daylight will
return.

###### 11
Sigh not, therefore, neither be moved; and say not in your heart
that this darkness is long and drags on wearily; and say not in your
heart that I plague you with it.

###### 12
Strengthen your heart, and be not afraid.  This darkness is not a
punishment.  But, O Adam, I have made the day, and have placed the sun
in it to give light; in order that you and your children should do your
work.

###### 13
For I knew you would sin and transgress, and come out into this
land.  Yet I wouldn't force you, nor be heard over you, nor shut up;
nor doom you through your fall; nor through your coming out from light
into darkness; nor yet through your coming from the garden into this
land.

###### 14
For I made you of the light; and I willed to bring out children of
light from you and like to you.

###### 15
But you did not keep My commandment one day; until I had finished
the creation and blessed everything in it.

###### 16
Then, concerning the tree, I commanded you not to eat of it.  Yet I
knew that Satan, who deceived himself, would also deceive you.

###### 17
So I made known to you by means of the tree, not to come near him.
And I told you not to eat of the fruit thereof, nor to taste of it, nor
yet to sit under it, nor to yield to it.

###### 18
Had I not been and spoken to you, O Adam, concerning the tree, and
had I left you without a commandment, and you had sinned--it would have
been an offence on My part, for not having given you any order; you
would turn around and blame Me for it.

###### 19
But I commanded you, and warned you, and you fell.  So that My
creatures cannot blame Me; but the blame rests on them alone.

###### 20
And, O Adam, I have made the day so that you and your descendants
can work and toil in it.  And I have made the night for them to rest in
it from their work; and for the beasts of the field to go forth by
night and look for their food.

###### 21
But little of darkness now remains, O Adam, and daylight will soon
appear."
