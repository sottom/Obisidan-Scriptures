###### 1
When it was morning, the day after they had eaten food, Adam and Eve
prayed in the cave, and Adam said to Eve, "Look, we asked for food of
God, and He gave it.  But now let us also ask Him to give us a drink of
water."

###### 2
Then they got up, and went to the bank of the stream of water, that
was on the south border of the garden, in which they had before thrown
themselves.  And they stood on the bank, and prayed to God that He
would command them to drink of the water.

###### 3
Then the Word of God came to Adam, and said to him, "O Adam, your
body has become brutish, and requires water to drink.  Take some and
drink it, you and Eve, then give thanks and praise."

###### 4
Adam and Eve then went down to the stream and drank from it, until
their bodies felt refreshed.  After having drunk, they praised God, and
then returned to their cave, after their former custom.  This happened
at the end of eighty-three days.

###### 5
Then on the eighty-fourth day, they took the two figs and hung them
in the cave, together with the leaves thereof, to be to them a sign and
a blessing from God.  And they placed them there so that if their
descendants came there, they would see the wonderful things God had
done for them.

###### 6
Then Adam and Eve again stood outside the cave, and asked God to show
them some food with which they could nourish their bodies.

###### 7
Then the Word of God came and said to him, "O Adam, go down to the
westward of the cave until you come to a land of dark soil, and there
you shall find food."

###### 8
And Adam obeyed the Word of God, took Eve, and went down to a land of
dark soil, and found there wheat growing in the ear and ripe, and figs
to eat; and Adam rejoiced over it.

###### 9
Then the Word of God came again to Adam, and said to him, "Take some
of this wheat and make yourselves some bread with it, to nourish your
body therewith."  And God gave Adam's heart wisdom, to work out the
corn until it became bread.

###### 10
Adam accomplished all that, until he grew very faint and weary.  He
then returned to the cave; rejoicing at what he had learned of what is
done with wheat, until it is made into bread for one's use.
