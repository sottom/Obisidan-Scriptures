###### 1
Then came the Word of God to Adam, and said to him:--

###### 2
"O Adam, as to what you said, 'Bring me into a land where there is
rest,' it is not another land than this, but it is the kingdom of
heaven where alone there is rest.

###### 3
But you can not make your entrance into it at present; but only after
your judgment is past and fulfilled.

###### 4
Then will I make you go up into the kingdom of heaven, you and your
righteous descendants; and I will give you and them the rest you ask
for at present.

###### 5
And if you said, 'Give me of the Water of Life that I may drink and
live'--it cannot be this day, but on the day that I shall descend into
hell, and break the gates of brass, and bruise in pieces the kingdoms
of iron.

###### 6
Then will I in mercy save your soul and the souls of the righteous,
to give them rest in My garden.  And that shall be when the end of the
world is come.

###### 7
And, again, in regards to the Water of Life you seek, it will not be
granted you this day; but on the day that I shall shed My blood on your
head in the land of Golgotha.

###### 8
For My blood shall be the Water of Life to you at that time, and not
to just you alone, but to all your descendants who shall believe in
Me; that it be to them for rest forever."

###### 9
The Lord said again to Adam, "O Adam, when you were in the garden,
these trials did not come to you.

###### 10
But since you transgressed My commandment, all these sufferings have
come over you.

###### 11
Now, also, does your flesh require food and drink; drink then of
that water that flows by you on the face of the earth.

###### 12
Then God withdrew His Word from Adam.

###### 13
And Adam and Eve worshipped the Lord, and returned from the river of
water to the cave.  It was noon-day; and when they drew near to the
cave, they saw a large fire by it.
