###### 1
Then God looked again at Adam and his crying and groaning, and the
Word of God came to him, and said to him:--

###### 2
"O Adam, when you were in My garden, you knew neither eating nor
drinking; neither faintness nor suffering; neither leanness of flesh,
nor change; neither did sleep depart from thine eyes.  But since you
transgressed, and came into this strange land, all these trials are
come over you."
