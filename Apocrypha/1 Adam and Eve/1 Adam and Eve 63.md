###### 1
But Adam and Eve, as they got closer to the cave, saw two fig trees,
covered with fruit, and overshadowing the cave.

###### 2
Then Adam said to Eve, "It seems to me that we have gone the wrong
way.  When did these two trees grow here?  It seems to me that the
enemy wishes to lead us the wrong way.  Do you suppose that there is
another cave besides this one in the earth?

###### 3
Yet, O Eve, let us go into the cave, and find in it the two figs; for
this is our cave, in which we were.  But if we should not find the two
figs in it, then it cannot be our cave."

###### 4
They went then into the cave, and looked into the four corners of it,
but found not the two figs.

###### 5
And Adam cried and said to Eve, "Did we go to the wrong cave, then, O
Eve?  It seems to me these two fig trees are the two figs that were in
the cave."  And Eve said, "I, for my part, do not know."

###### 6
Then Adam stood up and prayed and said, "O God, You commanded us to
come back to the cave, to take the two figs, and then to return to you.

###### 7
But now, we have not found them.  O God, have you taken them, and
sown these two trees, or have we gone astray in the earth; or has the
enemy deceived us?  If it be real, then, O God, reveal to us the secret
of these two trees and of the two figs."

###### 8
Then came the Word of God to Adam, and said to him, "O Adam, when I
sent you to fetch the figs, Satan went before you to the cave, took the
figs, and buried them outside, eastward of the cave, thinking to
destroy them; and not sowing them with good intent.

###### 9
Not for his mere sake, then, have these trees grown up at once; but I
had mercy on you and I commanded them to grow.  And they grew to be two
large trees, that you be overshadowed by their branches, and find rest;
and that I made you see My power and My marvelous works.

###### 10
And, also, to show you Satan's meanness, and his evil works, for
ever since you came out of the garden, he has not ceased, no, not one
day, from doing you some harm.  But I have not given him power over
you."

###### 11
And God said, "From now on, O Adam, rejoice on account of the trees,
you and Eve; and rest under them when you feel weary.  But do not eat
any of their fruit or come near them."

###### 12
Then Adam cried, and said, "O God, will You again kill us, or will
You drive us away from before Your face, and cut our life from off the
face of the earth?

###### 13
O God, I beg you, if You know that there be in these trees either
death or some other evil, as at the first time, root them up from near
our cave, and with them; and leave us to die of the heat, of hunger and
of thirst.

###### 14
For we know Your marvelous works, O God, that they are great, and
that by Your power You can bring one thing out of another, without
one's wish.  For Your power can make rocks to become trees, and trees
to become rocks."
