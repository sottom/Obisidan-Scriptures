###### 1
Then Adam said to God: "O Lord, take You my soul, and let me not see
this gloom any more; or remove me to some place where there is no
darkness."

###### 2
But God the Lord said to Adam, "Indeed I say to you, this darkness
will pass from you, every day I have determined for you, until the
fulfillment of My covenant; when I will save you and bring you back
again into the garden, into the house of light you long for, in which
there is no darkness.  I will bring you to it--in the kingdom of
heaven."

###### 3
Again said God to Adam, "All this misery that you have been made to
take on yourself because of your transgression, will not free you from
the hand of Satan, and will not save you.

###### 4
But I will.  When I shall come down from heaven, and shall become
flesh of your descendants, and take on Myself the infirmity from which
you suffer, then the darkness that covered you in this cave shall cover
Me in the grave, when I am in the flesh of your descendants.

###### 5
And I, who am without years, shall be subject to the reckoning of
years, of times, of months, and of days, and I shall be reckoned as one
of the sons of men, in order to save you."

###### 6
And God ceased to commune with Adam.
