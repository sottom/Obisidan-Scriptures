###### 1
But Satan, the hater of all good, did not allow them to finish their
prayers.  For he called to his hosts, and they came, all of them.  Then
he said to them, "Since Adam and Eve, whom we deceived, have agreed
together to pray to God night and day, and to beg Him to deliver them,
and since they will not come out of the cave until the end of the
fortieth day.

###### 2
And since they will continue their prayers as they have both agreed
to do, that He will deliver them out of our hands, and restore them to
their former state, see what we shall do to them."  And his hosts said
to him, "Power is thine, O our lord, to do what you list."

###### 3
Then Satan, great in wickedness, took his hosts and came into the
cave, in the thirtieth night of the forty days and one; and he beat
Adam and Eve, until he left them dead.

###### 4
Then came the Word of God to Adam and Eve, who raised them from their
suffering, and God said to Adam, "Be strong, and be not afraid of him
who has just come to you."

###### 5
But Adam cried and said, "Where were you, O my God, that they should
punish me with such blows, and that this suffering should come over us;
over me and over Eve, Your handmaiden?"

###### 6
Then God said to him, "O Adam, see, he is lord and master of all you
have, he who said, he would give you divinity.  Where is this love for
you?  And where is the gift he promised?

###### 7
Did it please him just once, O Adam, to come to you, comfort you,
strengthen you, rejoice with you, or send his hosts to protect you;
because you have obeyed him, and have yielded to his counsel; and have
followed his commandment and transgressed Mine?"

###### 8
Then Adam cried before the Lord, and said, "O Lord because I
transgressed a little, You have severely punished me in return for it,
I ask You to deliver me out of his hands; or else have pity on me, and
take my soul out of my body now in this strange land."

###### 9
Then God said to Adam, "If only there had been this sighing and
praying before, before you transgressed!  Then would you have rest from
the trouble in which you are now."

###### 10
But God had patience with Adam, and let him and Eve remain in the
cave until they had fulfilled the forty days.

###### 11
But as to Adam and Eve, their strength and flesh withered from
fasting and praying, from hunger and thirst; for they had not tasted
either food or drink since they left the garden; nor were the functions
of their bodies yet settled; and they had no strength left to continue
in prayer from hunger, until the end of the next day to the fortieth.
They were fallen down in the cave; yet what speech escaped from their
mouths, was only in praises.
