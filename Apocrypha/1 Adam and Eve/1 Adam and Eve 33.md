###### 1
But Satan, the hater of all good, sought them in the cave, but found
them not, although he searched diligently for them.

###### 2
But he found them standing in the water praying and thought within
himself, "Adam and Eve are standing like that in that water praying to
God to forgive them their transgression, and to restore them to their
former state, and to take them from under my hand.

###### 3
But I will deceive them so that they shall come out of the water, and
not fulfil their vow."

###### 4
Then the hater of all good, went not to Adam, but he went to Eve, and
took the form of an angel of God, praising and rejoicing, and said to
her:--

###### 5
"Peace be to you!  Be glad and rejoice!  God is favorable to you, and
He sent me to Adam.  I have brought him the glad tidings of salvation,
and of his being filled with bright light as he was at first.

###### 6
And Adam, in his joy for his restoration, has sent me to you, that
you come to me, in order that I crown you with light like him.

###### 7
And he said to me, 'Speak to Eve; if she does not come with you, tell
her of the sign when we were on the top of the mountain; how God sent
his angels who took us and brought us to the Cave of Treasures; and
laid the gold on the southern side; incense, on the eastern side; and
myrrh on the western side.'  Now come to him."

###### 8
When Eve hear these words from him, she rejoiced greatly.  And
thinking Satan's appearance was real, she came out of the sea.

###### 9
He went before, and she followed him until they came to Adam.  Then
Satan hid himself from her, and she saw him no more.

###### 10
She then came and stood before Adam, who was standing by the water
and rejoicing in God's forgiveness.

###### 11
And as she called to him, he turned around, found her there and
cried when he saw her, and beat his chest; and from the bitterness of
his grief, he sank into the water.

###### 12
But God looked at him and at his misery, and at his being about to
breathe his last.  And the Word of God came from heaven, raised him out
of the water, and said to him, "Go up the high bank to Eve."  And when
he came up to Eve he said to her, "Who told you to come here?"

###### 13
Then she told him the discourse of the angel who had appeared to her
and had given her a sign.

###### 14
But Adam grieved, and gave her to know it was Satan.  He then took
her and they both returned to the cave.

###### 15
These things happened to them the second time they went down to the
water, seven days after their coming out of the garden.

###### 16
They fasted in the water thirty-five days; altogether forty-two days
since they had left the garden.
