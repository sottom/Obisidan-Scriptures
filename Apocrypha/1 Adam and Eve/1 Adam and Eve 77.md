###### 1
But when Adam saw that the older brother hated the younger, he
endeavored to soften their hearts, and said to Cain, "O my son, take of
the fruits of your sowing and make an offering to God, so that He might
forgive you for your wickedness and sin."

###### 2
He said also to Abel, "Take some of your sowing and make an offering
and bring it to God, so that He might forgive you for your wickedness
and sin."

###### 3
Then Abel obeyed his father's voice, took some of his sowing, and
made a good offering, and said to his father, Adam, "Come with me and
show me how to offer it up."

###### 4
And they went, Adam and Eve with him, and they showed him how to
offer up his gift on the altar.  Then after that, they stood up and
prayed that God would accept Abel's offering.

###### 5
Then God looked at Abel and accepted his offering.  And God was more
pleased with Abel than with his offering, because of his good heart and
pure body.  There was no trace of guile in him.

###### 6
Then they came down from the altar, and went to the cave in which
they lived.  But Abel, by reason of his joy at having made his
offering, repeated it three times a week, after the example of his
father Adam.

###### 7
But as to Cain, he did not want to make an offering, but after his
father became very angry, he offered up a gift once.  He took the
smallest of his sheep for an offering and when he offered it up, his
eyes were on the lamb.

###### 8
Therefore God did not accept his offering, because his heart was full
of murderous thoughts.

###### 9
And they all thus lived together in the cave in which Eve had brought
forth, until Cain was fifteen years old, and Abel twelve years old.
