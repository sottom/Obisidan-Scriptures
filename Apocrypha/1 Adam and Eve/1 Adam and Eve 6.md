###### 1
But God looked at them; for they had killed themselves through great
grief.

###### 2
But He decided to raise them and comfort them.

###### 3
He, therefore, sent His Word to them; that they should stand and be
raised immediately.

###### 4
And the Lord said to Adam and Eve, "You transgressed of your own free
will, until you came out of the garden in which I had placed you.

###### 5
Of your own free will have you transgressed through your desire for
divinity, greatness, and an exalted state, such as I have; so that I
deprived you of the bright nature in which you then were, and I made
you come out of the garden to this land, rough and full of trouble.

###### 6
If only you had not transgressed My commandment and had kept My law,
and had not eaten of the fruit of the tree which I told you not to come
near!  And there were fruit trees in the garden better than that one.

###### 7
But the wicked Satan did not keep his faith and had no good intent
towards Me, that although I had created him, he considered Me to be
useless, and sought the Godhead for himself; for this I hurled him down
from heaven so that he could not remain in his first estate--it was he
who made the tree appear pleasant in your eyes, until you ate of it, by
believing his words.

###### 8
Thus have you transgressed My commandment, and therefore I have
brought on you all these sorrows.

###### 9
For I am God the Creator, who, when I created My creatures, did not
intend to destroy them.  But after they had sorely roused My anger, I
punished them with grievous plagues, until they repent.

###### 10
But, if on the contrary, they still continue hardened in their
transgression, they shall be under a curse forever."
