###### 1
Then Adam prepared an offering, and he and Eve offered it up for
their children, and brought it to the altar they had built at first.

###### 2
And Adam offered up the offering, and asked God to accept his
offering.

###### 3
Then God accepted Adam's offering, and sent a light from heaven that
shown on the offering.  Adam and his son drew near to the offering, but
Eve and the daughter did not approach it.

###### 4
Adam and his son were joyful as they came down from on the altar.
Adam and Eve waited until the daughter was eighty days old, then Adam
prepared an offering and took it to Eve and to the children. They went
to the altar, where Adam offered it up, as he was accustomed, asking
the Lord to accept his offering.

###### 5
And the Lord accepted the offering of Adam and Eve.  Then Adam, Eve,
and the children, drew near together, and came down from the mountain,
rejoicing.

###### 6
But they returned not to the cave in which they were born; but came
to the Cave of Treasures, in order that the children should go around
in it, and be blessed with the tokens brought from the garden.

###### 7
But after they had been blessed with these tokens, they went back to
the cave in which they were born.

###### 8
However, before Eve had offered up the offering, Adam had taken her,
and had gone with her to the river of water, in which they threw
themselves at first; and there they washed themselves.  Adam washed his
body and Eve hers also clean, after the suffering and distress that had
come over them.

###### 9
But Adam and Eve, after washing themselves in the river of water,
returned every night to the Cave of Treasures, where they prayed and
were blessed; and then went back to their cave, where their children
were born.

###### 10
Adam and Eve did this until the children had been weaned.  After
they were weaned, Adam made an offering for the souls of his children
in addition to the three times every week he made an offering for them.

###### 11
When the children were weaned, Eve again conceived, and when her
pregnancy came to term, she gave birth to another son and daughter.
They named the son Abel and the daughter Aklia.

###### 12
Then at the end of forty days, Adam made an offering for the son,
and at the end of eighty days he made another offering for the
daughter, and treated them, as he had previously treated Cain and his
sister Luluwa.

###### 13
He brought them to the Cave of Treasures, where they received a
blessing, and then returned to the cave where they were born.  After
these children were born, Eve stopped having children.
