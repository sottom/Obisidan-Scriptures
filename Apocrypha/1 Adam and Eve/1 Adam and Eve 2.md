###### 1
But when our father Adam, and Eve, went out of the garden, they
walked the ground on their feet, not knowing they were walking.

###### 2
And when they came to the opening of the gate of the garden, and saw
the broad earth spread before them, covered with stones large and
small, and with sand, they feared and trembled, and fell on their
faces, from the fear that came over them; and they were as dead.

###### 3
Because--whereas until this time they had been in the garden land,
beautifully planted with all manner of trees--they now saw themselves,
in a strange land, which they knew not, and had never seen.

###### 4
And because, when they were in the garden they were filled with the
grace of a bright nature, and they had not hearts turned toward earthly
things.

###### 5
Therefore God had pity on them; and when He saw them fallen before
the gate of the garden, He sent His Word to our father, Adam and Eve,
and raised them from their fallen state.
