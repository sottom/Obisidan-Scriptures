###### 1
After these things the Word of God came to Adam, and said to him:--

###### 2
"O Adam, as to the fruit on the Tree of Life that you have asked for,
I will not give it to you now, but only when the 5500 years are
fulfilled.  At that time I will give you fruit from the Tree of Life,
and you will eat, and live forever, you, and Eve, and your righteous
descendants.

###### 3
But these forty-three days cannot make amends for the hour in which
you transgressed My commandment.

###### 4
O Adam, I gave you the fruit of the fig-tree to eat in which you hid
yourself.  Go and eat of it, you and Eve.

###### 5
I will not deny your request, neither will I disappoint your hope;
therefore, endure until the fulfillment of the covenant I made with
you."

###### 6
And God withdrew His Word from Adam.
