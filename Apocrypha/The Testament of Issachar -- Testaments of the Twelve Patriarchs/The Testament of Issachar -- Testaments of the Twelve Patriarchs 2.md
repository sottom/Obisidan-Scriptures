###### 1
KNOW ye therefore, my children, that in the last times your sons will forsake singleness, and will cleave unto insatiable desire.

###### 2
And leaving guilelessness, will draw near to malice; and forsaking the commandments of the Lord, they will cleave unto Beliar.

###### 3
And leaving husbandry, they will follow after their own wicked devices, and they shall be dispersed among the Gentiles, and shall serve their enemies.

###### 4
And do you therefore give these commands to your children, that, if they sin, they may the more quickly return to the Lord; For He is merciful, and will deliver them, even to bring them back into their land.

###### 5
Behold, therefore, as ye see, I am a hundred and twenty-six years old and am not conscious of committing any sin.

###### 6
Except my wife I have not known any woman. I never committed fornication by the uplifting of my eyes.

###### 7
I drank not wine, to be led astray thereby;

###### 8
I coveted not any desirable thing that was my neighbour's.

###### 9
Guile arose not in my heart;

###### 10
A lie passed not through my lips.

###### 11
If any man were in distress I joined my sighs with his,

###### 12
And I shared my bread with the poor.

###### 13
I wrought godliness, all my days I kept truth.

###### 14
I loved the Lord; likewise also every man with all my heart.

###### 15
So do you also these things, my children, and every spirit of Beliar shall flee from you, and no deed of wicked men shall rule over you;

###### 16
And every wild beast shall ye subdue, since you have with you the God of heaven and earth and walk with men in singleness of heart.

###### 17
And having said these things, he commanded his sons that they should carry him up to Hebron, and bury him there in the cave with his fathers.

###### 18
And he stretched out his feet and died, at a good old age; with every limb sound, and with strength unabated, he slept the eternal sleep.
