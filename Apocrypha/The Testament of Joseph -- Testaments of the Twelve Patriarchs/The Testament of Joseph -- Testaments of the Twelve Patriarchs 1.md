###### 1
THE copy of the Testament of Joseph.

###### 2
When he was about to die he called his sons and his brethren together, and said to them:--

###### 3
My brethren and my children, hearken to Joseph the beloved of Israel; give ear, my sons, unto your father.

###### 4
I have seen in my life envy and death, yet I went not astray, but persevered in the truth--of the Lord.

###### 5
These my brethren hated me, but the Lord loved me:

###### 6
They wished to slay me, but the God of my fathers guarded me:

###### 7
They let me down into a pit, and the Most High brought me up again.

###### 8
I was sold into slavery, and the Lord of all made me free:

###### 9
I was taken into captivity, and His strong hand succoured me.

###### 10
I was beset with hunger, and the Lord Himself nourished me.

###### 11
I was alone, and God comforted me:

###### 12
I was sick, and the Lord visited me.

###### 13
I was in prison, and my God showed favour unto me;

###### 14
In bonds, and He released me;

###### 15
Slandered, and He pleaded my cause;

###### 16
Bitterly spoken against by the Egyptians, and He delivered me;

###### 17
Envied by my fellow-slaves, and He exalted me.

###### 18
And this chief captain of Pharaoh entrusted to me his house.

###### 19
And I struggled against a shameless woman, urging me to transgress with her; but the God of Israel my father delivered me from the burning flame.

###### 20
I was cast into prison, I was beaten, I was mocked; but the Lord granted me to find mercy, in the sight of the keeper of the prison.

###### 21
For the Lord doth not forsake them that fear Him, neither in darkness, nor in bonds, nor in tribulations, nor in necessities.

###### 22
For God is not put to shame as a man, nor as the son of man is he afraid, nor as one that is earth-born is He weak or affrighted.

###### 23
But in all those things doth He give protection, and in divers ways doth He comfort, though for a little space He departeth to try the inclination of the soul.

###### 24
In ten temptations He showed me approved, and in all of them I endured; for endurance is a mighty charm, and patience giveth many good things.

###### 25
How often did the Egyptian woman threaten me with death!

###### 26
How often did she give me over to punishment, and then call me back and threaten me, and when I was unwilling to company with her, she said to me:

###### 27
Thou shalt be lord of me, and all that is in my house, if thou wilt give thyself unto me, and thou shalt be as our master.

###### 28
But I remembered the words of my father, and going into my chamber, I wept and prayed unto the Lord.

###### 29
And I fasted in those seven years, and I appeared to the Egyptians as one living delicately, for they that fast for God's sake receive beauty of face.

###### 30
And if my lord were away from home, I drank no wine; nor for three days did I take my food, but I gave it to the poor and sick.

###### 31
And I sought the Lord early, and I wept for the Egyptian woman of Memphis, for very unceasingly did she trouble me, for also at night she came to me under pretence of visiting me.

###### 32
And because she had no male child she pretended to regard me as a son.

###### 33
And for a time she embraced me as a son, and I knew it not; but later, she sought to draw me into fornication.

###### 34
And when I perceived it I sorrowed unto death; and when she had gone out, I came to myself, and lamented for her many days, because I recognized her guile and her deceit.

###### 35
And I declared unto her the words of the Most High, if haply she would turn from her evil lust.

###### 36
Often, therefore, did she flatter me with words as a holy man, and guilefully in her talk praise my chastity before her husband, while desiring to ensnare me when we were alone.

###### 37
For she lauded me openly as chaste, and in secret she said unto me: Fear not my husband; for he is persuaded concerning thy chastity: for even should one tell him concerning us, he would not believe.

###### 38
Owing to all these things I lay upon the ground, and besought God that the Lord would deliver me from her deceit.

###### 39
And when she had prevailed nothing thereby, she came again to me under the plea of instruction, that she might learn the word of God.

###### 40
And she said unto me: If thou willest that I should leave my idols, lie with me, and I will persuade my husband to depart from his idols, and we will walk in the law by thy Lord.

###### 41
And I said unto her: The Lord willeth not. that those who reverence Him should be in uncleanness, nor doth He take pleasure in them that commit adultery, but in those that approach Him with a pure heart and undefiled lips.

###### 42
But she heed her peace, longing to accomplish her evil desire.

###### 43
And I gave myself yet more to fasting and prayer, that the Lord might deliver me from her.

###### 44
And again, at another time she said unto me: If thou wilt not commit adultery, I will kill my husband by poison; and take thee to be my husband.

###### 45
I therefore, when I heard this, rent my garments, and said unto her:

###### 46
Woman, reverence God, and do not this evil deed, lest thou be destroyed; for know indeed that I will declare this thy device unto all men.

###### 47
She therefore, being afraid, besought that I would not declare this device.

###### 48
And she departed soothing me with gifts, and sending to me every delight of the sons of men.

###### 49
And afterwards she sent me food mingled with enchantments.

###### 50
And when the eunuch who brought it came, I looked up and beheld a terrible man giving me with the dish a sword, and I perceived that her scheme was to beguile me.

###### 51
And when he had gone out I wept, nor did I taste that or any other of her food.

###### 52
So then after one day she came to me and observed the food, and said unto me: Why is it that thou hast not eaten of the food?

###### 53
And I said unto her: It is because thou hast filled it with deadly enchantments; and how saidst thou: I come not near to idols but to the Lord alone.

###### 54
Now therefore know that the God of my father hath revealed unto me by His angel thy wickedness, and I have kept it to convict thee, if haply thou mayst see and repent.

###### 55
But that thou mayst learn that the wickedness of the ungodly hath no power over them that worship God with chastity behold I will take of it and eat before thee.

###### 56
And having so said, I prayed thus: The God of my fathers and the angel of Abraham, be with me; and ate.

###### 57
And when she saw this she fell upon her face at my feet, weeping; and I raised her up and admonished her.

###### 58
And she promised to do this iniquity no more.

###### 59
But her heart was still set upon evil, and she looked around how to ensnare me, and sighing deeply she became downcast, though she was not sick.

###### 60
And when her husband saw her, he said unto her: Why is thy countenance fallen?

###### 61
And she said unto him: I have a pain at my heart, and the groanings of my spirit oppress me; and so he comforted her who was not sick.

###### 62
Then, accordingly seizing an opportunity, she rushed unto me while her husband was yet without, and said unto me: I will hang myself, or cast myself over a cliff, if thou wilt not lie with me.

###### 63
And when I saw the spirit of Beliar was troubling her, I prayed unto the Lord, and said unto her:

###### 64
Why, wretched woman, art thou troubled and disturbed, blinded through sins?

###### 65
Remember that if thou kill thyself, Asteho, the concubine of thy husband, thy rival, will beat thy children, and thou wilt destroy thy memorial from off the earth.

###### 66
And she said unto me: Lo, then thou lovest me; let this suffice me: only strive for my life and my children, and I expect that I shall enjoy my desire also.

###### 67
But she knew not that because of my lord I spake thus, and not because of her.

###### 68
For if a man hath fallen before the passion of a wicked desire and become enslaved by it, even as she, whatever good thing he may hear with regard to that passion, he receiveth it with a view to his wicked desire.

###### 69
I declare, therefore, unto you, my children, that it was about the sixth hour when she departed from me; and I knelt before the Lord all day, and all the night; and about dawn I rose up, weeping the while and praying for a release from her.

###### 70
At last, then, she laid hold of my garments, forcibly dragging me to have connexion with her.

###### 71
When, therefore, I saw that in her madness she was holding fast to my garment, I left it behind, and fled away naked.

###### 72
And holding fast to the garment she falsely accused me, and when her husband came he cast me into prison in his house; and on the morrow he scourged me and sent me into Pharaoh's prison.

###### 73
And when I was in bonds, the Egyptian woman was oppressed with grief, and she came and heard how I gave thanks unto the Lord and sang praises in the abode of darkness, and with glad voice rejoiced, glorifying my God that I was delivered from the lustful desire of the Egyptian woman.

###### 74
And often hath she sent unto me saying: Consent to fulfil my desire, and I will release thee from thy bonds, and I will free thee from the darkness.

###### 75
And not even in thought did I incline unto her.

###### 76
For God loveth him who in a den of wickedness combines fasting with chastity, rather than the man who in kings' chambers combines luxury with license.

###### 77
And if a man liveth in chastity, and desireth also glory, and the Most High knoweth that it is expedient for him, He bestoweth this also upon me.

###### 78
How often, though she were sick, did she come down to me at unlooked for times, and listened to my voice as I prayed!

###### 79
And when I heard her groanings I held my peace.

###### 80
For when I was in her house she was wont to bare her arms, and breasts, and legs, that I might lie with her; for she was very beautiful, splendidly adorned in order to beguile me.

###### 81
And the Lord guarded me from her devices.
