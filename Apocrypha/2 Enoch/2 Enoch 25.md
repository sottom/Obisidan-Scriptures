###### 1
I commanded in the very lowest (parts), that visible (physical) things should come down from invisible (spiritual), and Adoil came down very great, and I beheld him, and lo! He had a belly of great light.

###### 2
And I said to him: Become undone, Adoil, and let the visible (physical) (come) out of you.

###### 3
And he came undone, and a great light came out. And I (was) in the midst of the great light, and as there is born light from light, there came forth a great age, and showed all creation, which I had thought to create.

###### 4
And I saw that (it was) good.

###### 5
And I placed for myself a throne, and took my seat on it, and said to the light: Go thence up higher and fix yourself high above the throne, and be A foundation to the highest things.

###### 6
And above the light there is nothing else, and then I bent up and looked up from my throne.
