And I appointed the eighth day also, that the eighth day should be the first-created after my work, and that (the first seven) revolve in the form of the seventh thousand, and that at the beginning of the eighth thousand there should be a time of not-counting, endless, with neither years nor months nor weeks nor days nor hours.

###### 2
And now, Enoch, all that I have told you, all that you have understood, all that you have seen of heavenly things, all that you have seen on earth, and all that I have written in books by my great wisdom, all these things I have devised and created from the uppermost foundation to the lower and to the end, and there is no counsellor nor inheritor to my creations.

###### 3
I am self-eternal, not made with hands, and without change.

###### 4
My thought is my counsellor, my wisdom and my word are made, and my eyes observe all things how they stand here and tremble with terror.

###### 5
If I turn away my face, then all things will be destroyed.

###### 6
And apply your mind, Enoch, and know him who is speaking to you, and take thence the books which you yourself have written.

###### 7
And I give you Samuil and Raguil, who led you up, and the books, and go down to earth, and tell your sons all that I have told you, and all that you have seen, from the lower heaven up to my throne, and all the troops.

###### 8
For I created all forces, and there is none that resists me or that does not subject himself to me. For all subject themselves to my monarchy, and labour for my sole rule.

###### 9
Give them the books of the handwriting, and they will read (them) and will know me for the creator of all things, and will understand how there is no other God but me.

###### 10
And let them distribute the books of your handwritingâ€“children to children, generation to generation, nations to nations.

###### 11
And I will give you, Enoch, my intercessor, the archistratege Michael, for the handwritings of your fathers Adam, Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahaleleel, and Jared your father.
