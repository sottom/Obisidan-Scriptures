###### 1
Whoever hastens to make offerings before the Lord’s face, the Lord for his part will hasten that offering by granting of his work.

###### 2
But whoever increases his lamp before the Lord’s face and make not true judgment, the Lord will (not) increase his treasure in the realm of the highest.

###### 3
When the Lord demands bread, or candles, or (the )flesh (of beasts), or any other sacrifice, then that is nothing; but God demands pure hearts, and with all that (only) tests the heart of man.
