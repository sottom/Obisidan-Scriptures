###### 1
I swear to you, my children, but I swear not by any oath, neither by heaven nor by earth, nor by any other creature which God created.

###### 2
The Lord said: There is no oath in me, nor injustice, but truth.

###### 3
If there is no truth in men, let them swear by the words, Yea, yea, or else, Nay, nay.

###### 4
And I swear to you, yea, yea, that there has been no man in his motherâ€™s womb, (but that) already before, even to each one there is a place prepared for the repose of that soul, and a measure fixed how much it is intended that a man be tried in this world.

###### 5
Yea, children, deceive not yourselves, for there has been previously prepared a place for every soul of man.
