###### 1
Whoever defiles the soul of beasts, defiles his own soul.

###### 2
For man brings clean animals to make sacrifice for sin, that he may have cure of his soul.

###### 3
And if they bring for sacrifice clean animals, and birds, man has cure, he cures his soul.

###### 4
All is given you for food, bind it by the four feet, that is to make good the cure, he cures his soul.

###### 5
But whoever kills beast without wounds, kills his own souls and defiles his own flesh.

###### 6
And he who does any beast any injury whatsoever, in secret, it is evil practice, and he defiles his own soul.
