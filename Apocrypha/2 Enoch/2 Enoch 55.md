###### 1
My children, behold, the day of my term and time have approached.

###### 2
For the angels who shall go with me are standing before me and urge me to my departure from you; they are standing here on earth, awaiting what has been told them.

###### 3
For to-morrow I shall go up on to heaven, to the uppermost Jerusalem to my eternal inheritance.

###### 4
Therefore I bid you do before the Lordâ€™s face all (his) good pleasure.
