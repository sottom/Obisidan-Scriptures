###### 1
And into another place hard by, full of filth, do they cast men and women up to the knees. These are they that lent money and took usury.

###### 2
And other men and women cast themselves down from an high place and return again and run, and devils drive them. These are the worshippers of idols and they put them to the end of their witst drive them up to the top of the height and they cast themselves down. And thus do they continually, and are tormented for ever. These are they which have cut their flesh as
[apostles] of a man: and the women that were with them . . . and these are the men that defiled themselves together as women.

###### 3
And beside them . . . and beneath them shall the angel Ezrael prepare a place of much fire: and all the idols of gold and silver, all idols, the work of men's hands, and the semblances of images of cats and lions, of creeping things and wild beasts, and the men and women that have prepared the images thereof, shall be in chains of fire and shall be chastised because of their error before the idols, and this is their judgement for ever.

###### 4
And beside them shall be other men and women, burning in the fire of the judgement, and their torment is everlasting. These are they that have forsaken the commandment of God and followed the (persuasions ?) of devils.
