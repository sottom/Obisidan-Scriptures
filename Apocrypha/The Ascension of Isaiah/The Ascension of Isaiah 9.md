###### 1
And he took me into the air of the seventh heaven, and moreover I heard a voice saying: "How far will he ascend that dwelleth in the flesh?" And I feared and trembled.

###### 2
And when I trembled, behold, I heard from hence another voice being sent forth, and saying: "It is permitted to the holy Isaiah to ascend hither; for here is his garment."

###### 3
And I asked the angel who was with me and said: "Who is he who forbade me and who is he who permitted me to ascend?"

###### 4
And he said unto me: "He who forbade thee, is he who is over the praise-giving of the sixth heaven.

###### 5
And He who permitted thee, this is thy Lord God, the Lord Christ, who will be called "Jesus" in the world, but His name thou canst not hear till thou hast ascended out of thy body."

###### 6
And he raised me up into the seventh heaven, and I saw there a wonderful light and angels innumerable.

###### 7
And there I saw the holy Abel and all the righteous.

###### 8
And there I saw Enoch and all who were with him, stript of the garments of the flesh, and I saw them in their garments of the upper world, and they were like angels, standing there in great glory.

###### 9
And there I saw Enoch and all who were with him, stript of the garments of the flesh, and I saw them in their garments of the upper world, and they were like angels, standing there in great glory.

###### 10
But they sat not on their thrones, nor were their crowns of glory on them.

###### 11
And I asked the angel who was with me: "How is it that they have received the garments, but have not the thrones and the crowns?"

###### 12
And he said unto me: "Crowns and thrones of glory they do not receive, till the Beloved will descent in the form in which you will see Him descent [will descent, I say] into the world in the last days the Lord, who will be called Christ.

###### 13
Nevertheless they see and know whose will be thrones, and whose the crowns when He has descended and been made in your form, and they will think that He is flesh and is a man.

###### 14
And the god of that world will stretch forth his hand against the Son, and they will crucify Him on a tree, and will slay Him not knowing who He is.

###### 15
And thus His descent, as you will see, will be hidden even from the heavens, so that it will not be known who He is.

###### 16
And when He hath plundered the angel of death, He will ascend on the third day, [and he will remain in that world five hundred and forty-five days].

###### 17
And then many of the righteous will ascend with Him, whose spirits do not receive their garments till the Lord Christ ascend and they ascend with Him.

###### 18
Then indeed they will receive their [garments and] thrones and crowns, when He has ascended into the seventh heaven."

###### 19
And I said unto him that which I had asked him in the third heaven:

###### 20
"Show me how everything which is done in that world is here made known."

###### 21
And whilst I was still speaking with him, behold one of the angels who stood nigh, more glorious than the glory of that angel, who had raised me up from the world.

###### 22
Showed me a book, [but not as a book of this world] and he opened it, and the book was written, but not as a book of this world. And he gave (it) to me and I read it, and lo! the deeds of the children of Israel were written therein, and the deeds of those whom I know (not), my son Josab.

###### 23
And I said: "In truth, there is nothing hidden in the seventh heaven, which is done in this world."

###### 24
And I saw there many garments laid up, and many thrones and many crowns.

###### 25
And I said to the angel: "Whose are these garments and thrones and crowns?"

###### 26
And he said unto me: "These garments many from that world will receive, believing in the words of That One, who shall be named as I told thee, and they will observe those things, and believe in them, and believe in His cross: for them are these laid up."

###### 27
And I saw a certain One standing, whose glory surpassed that of all, and His glory was great and wonderful.

###### 28
And after I had seen Him, all the righteous whom I had seen and also the angels whom I had seen came to Him. And Adam and Abel and Seth and all the righteous first drew near and worshipped Him, and they all praised Him with one voice, and I myself also gave praise with them, and my giving of praise was as theirs.

###### 29
And then all the angels drew nigh and worshipped and gave praise.

###### 30
And I was (again) transformed and became like an angel.

###### 31
And thereupon the angel who conducted me said to me: "Worship this One," and I worshipped and praised.

###### 32
And the angel said unto me: "This is the Lord of all the praise-givings which thou hast seen."

###### 33
And whilst he was still speaking, I saw another Glorious One who was like Him, and the righteous drew nigh and worshipped and praised, and I praised together with them. But my glory was not transformed into accordance with their form.

###### 34
And thereupon the angels drew near and worshipped Him.

###### 35
And I saw the Lord and the second angel, and they were standing.

###### 36
And the second whom I saw was on he left of my Lord. And I asked: "Who is this?" and he said unto me: "Worship Him, for He is the angel of the Holy Spirit, who speaketh in thee and the rest of the righteous."

###### 37
And I saw the great glory, the eyes of my spirit being open, and I could not thereupon see, nor yet could the angel who was with me, nor all the angels whom I had seen worshipping my Lord.

###### 38
But I saw the righteous beholding with great power the glory of that One.

###### 39
And my Lord drew nigh to me and the angel of the Spirit and He said: "See how it is given to thee to see God, and on thy account power is given to the angel who is with thee."

###### 40
And I saw how my Lord and the angel of the Spirit worshipped, and they both together praised God.

###### 41
And thereupon all the righteous drew near and worshipped.

###### 42
And the angels drew near and worshipped and all the angels praised.
