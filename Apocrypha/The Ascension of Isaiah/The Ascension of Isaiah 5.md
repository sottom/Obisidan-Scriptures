###### 1
On account of these visions, therefore, Beliar was wroth with Isaiah, and he dwelt in the heart of Manasseh and he sawed him in sunder with a wooden saw.

###### 2
And when Isaiah was being sawn in sunder, Belchira stood up, accusing him, and all the false prophets stood up, laughing and rejoicing because of Isaiah.

###### 3
And Belchira, with the aid of Mechembechus, stood up before Isaiah, [laughing] deriding;

###### 4
And Belchira said to Isaiah: "Say, "I have lied in all that I have spoken, and likewise the ways of Manasseh are good and right.

###### 5
And the ways also of Belchira and of his associates are good."

###### 6
And this he said to him when he began to be sawn in sunder.

###### 7
But Isaiah was (absorbed) in a vision of the Lord, and though his eyes were open, he saw them (not).

###### 8
And Belchira spake thus to Isaiah: "Say what I say unto thee and I will turn their hearts, and I will compel Manasseh and the princes of Judah and the people and all Jerusalem to reverence thee.

###### 9
And Isaiah answered and said: "So far as I have utterance (I say): Damned and accused be thou and all they powers and all thy house.

###### 10
For thou canst not take (from me) aught save the skin of my body."

###### 11
And they seized and sawed in sunder Isaiah, the son of Amoz, with a wooden saw.

###### 12
And Manasseh and Belchira and the false prophets and the princes and the people [and] all stood looking on.

###### 13
And to the prophets who were with him he said before he had been sawn in sunder: "Go ye to the region of Tyre and Sidon; for for me only hath God mingled the cup."

###### 14
And when Isaiah was being sawn in sunder, he neither cried aloud nor wept, but his lips spake with the Holy Spirit until he was sawn in twain.

###### 15
This, Beliar did to Isaiah through Belchira and Manasseh; for Sammael was very wrathful against Isaiah from the days of Hezekiah, king of Judah, on account of the things which he had seen regarding the Beloved.

###### 16
And on account of the destruction of Sammael, which he had seen through the Lord, while Hezekiah his father was still king. And he did according to the will of Satan.
