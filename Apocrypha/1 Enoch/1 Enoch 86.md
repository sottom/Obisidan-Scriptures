And again I saw with mine eyes as I slept, and I saw the heaven above, and behold a star fell from heaven, and it arose and eat and pastured amongst those oxen. [86:2] And after that I saw the large and the black oxen, and behold they all changed their stalls and pastures and their cattle, and began to live with each other. [86:3] And again I saw in the vision, and looked towards the heaven, and behold I saw many stars descend and cast themselves down from heaven to that first star, and they became bulls amongst those cattle and pastured with them ⌈amongst them⌉. [86:4] And I looked at them and saw, and behold they all let out their privy members, like horses, and began to cover the cows of the oxen, and they all became pregnant and bare elephants, camels, and asses. [86:5] And all the oxen feared them and were affrighted at them, and began to bite with their teeth and to devour, and to gore with their horns. [86:6] And they began, moreover, to devour those oxen; and behold all the children of the earth began to tremble and quake before them and to flee from them.
