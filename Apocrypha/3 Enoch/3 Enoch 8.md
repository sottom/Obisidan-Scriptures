###### 1
Before He appointed me to attend the Throne of Glory, the Holy One, blessed be He, opened to me: three hundred thousand gates of Understanding;
three hundred thousand gates of Subtlety;
three hundred thousand gates of Life;
three hundred thousand gates of grace and loving-kindness;
three hundred thousand gates of love;
three hundred thousand gates of Tora;
three hundred thousand gates of meekness;
three hundred thousand gates of maintenance;
three hundred thousand gates' of mercy;
three hundred thousand gates of fear of heaven.


###### 2
In that hour the Holy One, blessed be He, added in me wisdom unto wisdom, understanding unto understanding, subtlety unto subtlety, knowledge unto knowledge, mercy unto mercy, instruction unto instruction, love unto love, loving-kindness unto loving-kindness, goodness unto goodness, meekness unto meekness, power unto power, strength unto strength, might unto might, brilliance unto brilliance, beauty unto beauty, splendour unto splendour, and I was honoured and adorned with all these good and praiseworthy things more than all the children of heaven.
