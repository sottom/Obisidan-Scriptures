###### 1
And it shall come to pass after these things, when the time of the advent of the Messiah is fulfilled, that He shall return in glory. Then all who have fallen asleep in hope of Him shall rise again.

###### 2
And it shall come to pass at that time that the treasuries will be opened in which is preserved the number of the souls of the righteous, and they shall come forth, and a multitude of souls shall be seen together in one assemblage of one thought, and the first shall rejoice and the last shall not be grieved.

###### 3
For they know that the time has come of which it is said, that it is the consummation of the times.

###### 4
But the souls of the wicked, when they behold all these things, shall then waste away the more.

###### 5
For they shall know that their torment has come and their perdition has arrived.'
