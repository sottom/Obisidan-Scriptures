###### 1
And I answered and said: 'Lo! Thou hast shown me the method of the times, and that which shall be alter these things

###### 2
And Thou hast said unto me, that the retribution, which has been spoken of by Thee, shall come upon the nations. And now I know that those who have sinned are many, and they have lived in prosperity, and departed from the world, but that few nations will be left in those times, to whom those words shall be said which Thou didst say.

###### 3
For what advantage is there in this, or what (evil), worse than what we have seen befall us, are we to expect to see?

###### 4
But again I will speak in Thy presence:

###### 5
What have they profited who had knowledge before Thee, and have not walked in vanity as the rest of the nations, and have not said to the dead: "Give us life," but always feared Thee, and have not left Thy ways?

###### 6
And lo! they have been carried off, nor on their account hast Thou had mercy on Zion.

###### 7
And if others did evil, it was due to Zion, that on account of the works of those who wrought good works she should be forgiven, and should not be overwhelmed on account of the works of those who wrought unrighteousness.

###### 8
But who, O Lord, my Lord, will comprehend Thy judgement, Or who will search out the profoundness of Thy way? Or who will think out the weight of Thy path?

###### 9
Or who will be able to think out Thy incomprehensible counsel? Or who of those that are born has ever found The beginning or end of Thy wisdom?

###### 10
For we have all been made like a breath.

###### 11
For as the breath ascends involuntarily, and again dies, so it is with the nature of men, who depart not according to their own will, and know not what will befall them in the end.

###### 12
For the righteous justly hope for the end, and without fear depart from this habitation, because they have with Thee a store of works preserved in treasuries.

###### 13
On this account also these without fear leave this world, and trusting with joy they hope to receive the world which Thou hast promised them.

###### 14
But as for us -- woe to us, who also are now shamefully entreated, and at that time look forward (only) to evils.

###### 15
But Thou knowest accurately what Thou hast done by means of Thy servants; for we are not able to understand that which is good as Thou art, our Creator.

###### 16
But again I will speak in Thy presence, O LORD, my Lord.

###### 17
When of old there was no world with its inhabitants, Thou didst devise and speak with a word, and forthwith the works of creation stood before Thee.

###### 18
And Thou didst say that Thou wouldst make for Thy world man as the administrator of Thy works, that it might be known that he was by no means made on account of the world, but the world on account of him.

###### 19
And now I see that as for the world which was made on account of us, lo! it abides, but we, on account of whom it was made, depart.'
