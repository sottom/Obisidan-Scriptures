###### 1
And I went thence and sat in the valley of Cedron in a cave of the earth, and I sanctified my soul there, and I eat no bread, yet I was not hungry, and I drank no water, yet I thirsted not, and I was there till the seventh day, as He had commanded me.

###### 2
And afterwards I came to that place where He had spoken with me.

###### 3
And it came to pass at sunset that my soul took much thought, and I began to speak in the presence of the Mighty One, and said:

###### 4
'O Thou that hast made the earth, hear me, that hast fixed the firmament by the word, and hast made firm the height of the heaven by the spirit, that hast called from the beginning of the world that which did not yet exist, and they obey Thee.

###### 5
Thou that hast commanded the air by Thy nod, and hast seen those things which are to be as those things which Thou art doing.

###### 6
Thou that rulest with great thought the hosts that stand before Thee: also the countless holy beings, which Thou didst make from the beginning, of flame and fire, which stand around Thy throne Thou rulest with indignation.

###### 7
To Thee only does this belong that Thou shouldst do forth with whatsoever Thou dost wish.

###### 8
Who causest the drops of rain to rain by number upon the earth, and alone knowest the consummation of the times before they come; have respect unto my prayer.

###### 9
For Thou alone art able to sustain all who are, and those who have passed away, and those who are to be, those who sin, and those who are righteous [as living (and) being past finding out].

###### 10
For Thou alone dost live immortal and past finding out, and knowest the number of mankind.

###### 11
And if in time many have sinned, yet others not a few have been righteous.

###### 12
Thou knowest where Thou preservest the end of those who have sinned, or the consummation of those who have been righteous.

###### 13
For if there were this life only, which belongs to all men, nothing could be more bitter than this,

###### 14
For of what profit is strength that turns to sickness, Or fullness of food that turns to famine, Or beauty that turns to ugliness.

###### 15
For the nature of man is always changeable.

###### 16
For what we were formerly now we no longer are, and what we now are we shall not afterwards remain.

###### 17
For if a consummation had not been prepared for all, in vain would have been their beginning.

###### 18
But regarding everything that comes from Thee, do Thou inform me, and regarding everything about which I ask Thee, do Thou enlighten me.

###### 19
How long will that which is corruptible remain, and how long will the time of mortals be prospered, and until what time will those who transgress in the world be polluted with much wickedness?

###### 20
Command therefore in mercy and accomplish all that Thou saidst Thou wouldst bring, that Thy might may be made known to those who think that Thy long-suffering is weakness.

###### 21
And show to those who know not, that everything that has befallen us and our city until now has been according to the long-suffering of Thy power, because on account of Thy name Thou hast called us a beloved people.

###### 22
Bring to an end therefore henceforth mortality.

###### 23
And reprove accordingly the angel of death, and let Thy glory appear, and let the might of Thy beauty be known, and let Sheol be sealed so that from this time forward it may not receive the dead, and let the treasuries of souls restore those which are enclosed in them.

###### 24
For there have been many years like those that are desolate from the days of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, and of all those who are like them, who sleep in the earth, on whose account Thou didst say that Thou hadst created the world.

###### 25
And now quickly show Thy glory, and do not defer what has been promised by Thee.'

###### 26
And (when) I had completed the words of this prayer I was greatly weakened.
