###### 1
And I Baruch said to the angel, Let me ask thee one thing, Lord.

###### 2
Since thou didst say to me that the dragon drinks one cubit out of the sea, say to me also, how great is his belly?

###### 3
And the angel said, His belly is Hades; and as far as a plummet is thrown (by) three hundred men, so great is his belly. Come, then, that I may show thee also greater works than these.
