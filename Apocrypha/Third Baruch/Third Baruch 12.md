###### 1
And as I was conversing with them, behold angels came bearing baskets full of flowers. And they gave them to Michael.

###### 2
And I asked the angel, Lord, who are these, and what are the things brought hither from beside them?

###### 3
And he said to me, These are angels (who) are over the righteous.

###### 4
And the archangel took the baskets, and cast them into the vessel.

###### 5
And the angel said to me, These flowers are the merits of the righteous.

###### 6
And I saw other angels bearing baskets which were (neither) empty-nor full. And they began to lament, and did not venture to draw near, because they had not the prizes complete.

###### 7
And Michael cried and said, Come hither, also, ye angels, bring what ye have brought.

###### 8
And Michael was exceedingly grieved, and the angel who was with me, because they did not fill the vessel.
